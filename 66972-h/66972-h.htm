<p>Sez Josiah, as he see me writin’ this preface:</p>

<p>“Seems to me, Samantha, you’ve writ enough
prefaces.”</p>

<p>(He wanted me to start the supper; but, good
land! it wuzn’t only half past five, and I had a
spring chicken all ready to fry, and my cream biscuit
wuz all ready for the oven, on the kitchen table.)</p>

<p>Sez he, “It seems to me you’ve writ enough on
em.”</p>

<p>And I sez, “Wall, Josiah, I’d hate to sadden the
world by sayin’ I wouldn’t write any more.”</p>

<p>And he sez, “How do you know it would sadden
the world&mdash;how do you know it would?” And
he continued: “Samantha, I hain’t wanted to
dampen you, but I have always considered your
writin’s weak; naterally they would be, bein’ writ
by a woman; and,” sez he, as he looked longin’ly
towards the buttery door and the plump chicken,
“a woman’s spear lays in a different direction.”</p>

<p>And I sez, “I thought I’d write some of our adventures
in our trip abroad&mdash;that happy time,” sez
I, lookin’ inquirin’ly at him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>
<p>“Happy time!” sez he, a-kinder ’nashin’ his teeth&mdash;“happy!
gracious Heavens! Do you want to
bring up my sufferin’s agin, when I jest lived
through ’em?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, a-gittin’ up and approachin’ the
buttery, and takin’ down the tea-kettle and fryin’-pan
and coffee-pot, “I have writ other things in the
book that I am more interested in myself.”</p>

<p>He sot kinder still and demute as I put the
chicken on to fry in butter, and put the cream biscuit
in the oven, and poured the bilein’ water on the
fragrant coffee; his mean seemed to grow softer,
and he sez:</p>

<p>“Mebby I wuz too hash a-sayin’ what I did
about your writin’s, Samantha; I guess you write
as well as you know how to; I guess you <i>mean</i>
well;” and as he see me a-spreadin’ the snowy table-cloth
on the little round table, and a-puttin’ on some
cream cheese and some peach sass, he sez further:</p>

<p>“Nobody is to blame for what they don’t
know, Samantha.”</p>

<p>I looked down affectionately and pityin’ly on
his old bald head and then further off&mdash;way off
into mysterious spaces no mortal feet has ever trod,
and I sez:</p>

<p>“That is so, Josiah.”</p>

<p>But here&mdash;oh! how fur-off, illimitable, unaproachable,
duz that fur-off glory look!</p>

<p>And Mars seemed to wink that red eye of hisen
at me mockin’ly as I strained my eyes over the long
watery plain, as if to say&mdash;“The time has been when
you wuz free to roam round, a-walkin’ off afoot;
you may have gloated over me in your free thoughts
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are fixed and sot up there, while I am free
to soar and sail. Now, haughty female mortal,
your wings are clipped&mdash;the time has come when
your walkin’ afoot and roamin’ round is stopped.”</p>

<p>To think that I myself, Josiah Allen’s Wife,
should find myself on the Atlantic a-hangin’ onto
the gunwale of the ship with one hand, and a-lookin’
off over the endless waters below and all
round me, and a-thinkin’ if I should trust myself to
step out onto its heavey, treacherous surface where
should I go to, and when, and why! I, Samantha,
who had ever been ust to slippin’ on my sun-bunnet
and runnin’ into Miss Bobbettses, or out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
into the garden, or out to the hen-house for eggs,
or down into the orchard, or the wood paster for
recreation or cowslips.</p>

<p>To think that I wuz thus caged up as it were,
my restless wings (speakin’ in metafor) folded in
such clost quarters, with no chance (to foller up the
metafor) of floppin’ ’em to any extent.</p>

<p>Oh! where wuz I? The thought wuz full of or.
Why wuz I? This thought brung on trains of
retrospection.</p>

<p>As I sot in my contracted corner of the aft fore-castle
deck, and Night wuz lettin’ down, gradual,
her starry mantilly over me and the seen, as erst it
did over me as I sot in the sweet, restful door-yard
at Jonesville. (Dear seen, shall I ever see thee
agin?)</p>

<p>I will rehearse the facts that led to my takin’
this onpresidented step.</p>

<p>My pardner is asleep in his narrer bunk, or ruther
on one of the shelves in our cell, that are cushioned,
and on which our two forms nightly repose.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Asleep in his narrer bunk.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He is at rest. The waves are asleep, or pretty
nigh asleep, the night winds are hushed, and all
Nater seems to draw in her breath and wait for me
as I tell the tale.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<p>I will begin, as most fashionable novelists do, with
a verse of poetry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Backward, turn backward (as fur as Jonesville), Oh Time, in thy flight&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make me (a trusty, short-winded, female historian) jest for to-night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It wuz now goin’ on three years sence Uncle
Philander Smith’s son, Philander Martin, named
after his Pa and his Uncle Martin, writ a line to
me announcin’ his advent into Jonesville. And in
speakin’ of Philander I shall have to go back, kinder
sideways, some distance into the past to describe
him.</p>

<p>Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
I will have to lead the horse fur back to
hitch it on properly to the wagon of my history, or
mebby it would be more proper, under the circumstances,
to say how fur I must row my little personal
life-boat back to hitch it onto the great steamer
of my statement, in order that there shall be direct
smooth sailin’ and no meanderin’.</p>

<p>Wall, with the first paddle of my verbal row-boat,
I would state&mdash;</p>

<p>(And into how many little still side coves and
seemin’ly wind-locked ways my little life-boat must
sail on her way back to be jined to the great steamer,
and how I must stay in ’em for some time! It can’t
be helped.)</p>

<p>Yes, it must have been pretty nigh three years
ago that we had our first letter from P. Martyn
Smythe.</p>

<p>He is my second cousin on my own side. And
he sot out from Spoonville (a neighborin’ hamlet)
years ago with lots of ambition and pluck and
energy, and about one dollar and seventy-five cents
in money.</p>

<p>Uncle Philander, his father, had a big family, and
died leavin’ him nothin’ but his good example and
some old spectacles and a cane.</p>

<p>He wuz brung up by his Uncle Martin, a good-natered
creeter, but onfaculized and shiftless.</p>

<p>Young Martin never loved to be hampered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> and
after he got old enough to help his uncle, he didn’t
want to be hampered with him, so he packed up
his little knapsack and sot out to seek his fortune,
and he prospered beyend any tellin’, bought some
mines, and railroads, and things, and at last come
back East and settled down in a neighborin’ city,
and then got rid of several things that he found
hamperin’ to him. Amongst ’em wuz his old name&mdash;now
he calls it “Smythe.”</p>

<p>Yes, he got rid of the good, reliable old Smith
name, that has stood by so many human bein’s even
unto the end. And he got rid, too, of his conscience,
the biggest heft of it, and his poor relations.</p>

<p>For why, indeed, should a Bill or a Tom Smith
claim relationship with a P. Martyn Smythe?</p>

<p>Why, indeed! He got rid of ’em all in a heap, as
it were, a-ignorin’ “the hull kit and bilein’ of ’em,”
as Aunt Debby said.</p>

<p>“Never seen hide nor hair of any of ’em, from
one year’s end to the other,” sez Aunt Debby.</p>

<p>As to his conscience, he got rid of that, I spoze,
kinder gradual, a little at a time, till to all human
appearance he hadn’t a speck left, of which more
anon.</p>

<p>But there wuz a little of it left, enough to leven
his hull nater and raise it up, some like hop yeast,
only stronger and more spiritual (as will also be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
seen anon).</p>

<p>Wall, he never seemed to know where his cousin,
she that wuz Samantha Smith, lived, and his neck
seemed to be made in that way&mdash;kinder held up by
his stiff white collar mebby&mdash;that it held his head
up firm and immovable, so’s he didn’t see me nor my
Josiah when he’d meet him once in a great while at
some quarterly meetin’ or conferences and sech.</p>

<p>I guess that neck of hisen carried him so straight
that he couldn’t seem to turn it towards the old
Smith pew at all.</p>

<p>And then he wuz dretful near-sighted, too; his
eyes wuz affected dretful curous.</p>

<p>Uncle Mart Smith, the one P. Martin wuz
named after, atted him about it, for he wuz his
own uncle, and dretful shiftless and poor, but a
Christian as fur as he could be with his nateral laziness
on him.</p>

<p>As I say, he partly brung Martin up. A good-natered
creeter he wuz. And one day he walked
right up and atted P. Martyn Smythe as to why he
never could see him.</p>

<p>And P. Martyn sed that it wuz his eyesight; sez
he, “I’m dretful near-sighted.”</p>

<p>It made it all right with Uncle Martin, but his
wife, Aunt Debby, she sed, “Why can he see bishops
and elders so plain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Wall,” sez Uncle Mart, “it is a curous complaint.”
And she sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Tain’t curous a mite; it’s as nateral as ingratitude,
and as old as Pharo.”</p>

<p>And she and Uncle Mart had some words about it.</p>

<p>Wall, his eyesight seemed to grow worse and
worse so fur as old friends and relations wuz concerned,
till all of a sudden&mdash;it wuz after my third
book had shook the world, or I spoze it did; it
kinder jarred it anyway, I guess&mdash;wall, what
should that man, P. Martyn, do, but write to me
and invite me to the big city where he lived.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Relations ort to cling closter to each
other;” sez he, “Come and stay a week.”</p>

<p>I answered his note, cool but friendly.</p>

<p>And then he writ agin, and asked me to come
and stay a month. Agin my answer wuz Christian,
but about as cool as well water.</p>

<p>And then he writ agin and asked me to come
and stay a year with ’em. And he would be glad,
he said, he and his two motherless children, if I
would come and live with ’em always.</p>

<p>This allusion to the motherless melted me down
some, and my reply wuz, I spoze, about the temperture
of milk jest from the cow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>But I said that Duty and Josiah binded me to
my home and Jonesville.</p>

<p>Wall, the next summer what should P. Martyn
do but to write to me that he and Alice and
Adrian, his two children, wuz a-comin’ to Jonesville,
and would we take ’em in for a week? He
thought his children needed fresh air and a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
cossetin’.</p>

<p>Wall, to me, Josiah Allen’s wife, who has brung
up almost numberless lambs and chickens by hand
as cossets, this allusion to “cossetin’” melted me so
and warmed up my nater, that my reply wuz about
the temperture of skim milk het for the calves.</p>

<p>So they come.</p>

<p>And indeed I said then what I say now, and I’ll
defy anybody to dispute me, that two prettier, winnin’er
creeters never lived than them two children.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp58" id="i_009" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Two prettier, winnin’er creeters never lived than them two.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Alice wuz about sixteen then, and Adrian wuz
about five, and wuzn’t they happy! My hull heart
went out to ’em, and mebby it wuz that love
atmosphere that wropped ’em completely round
that made ’em grow so bright and cheerful and
healthy.</p>

<p>There hain’t no atmosphere that is at the same
time so inspirin’ and so restful as the heart atmosphere
of love.</p>

<p>You can always tell ’em that breathe its rare,
fine atmosphere by the radiance in their faces and
the lightness of their step.</p>

<p>I loved them two children dearly. They wuz
both as handsome as picters, Alice fair and slender
and sweet as a white day lily, with big, happy blue
eyes, and hair of the same gold color that her
mother had had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Adrian had long curls of that same wonderful
golden hair, and his eyes wuz big, inspirin’, blue
gray, and his lips always seemed to hold a happy
secret. He had that look some way.</p>

<p>Though what it could be we couldn’t tell, for he
talked pretty much all the time.</p>

<p>And the questions he asked would more’n fill
our old family Bible, I’m sure, and I thought some
of the time that the overflow would fill Foxe’s
“Book of Martyrs.”</p>

<p>Why, one day we got old Uncle Smedley to
mow our lawn while Adrian wuz there, and I felt
sorry that I didn’t put down the questions that
Adrian asked that perfectly deaf man as he trotted
along in his little velvet suit by the side of the lawn
mower.</p>

<p>But then I d’no as I’m sorry, after all, for paper
is sometimes skurce, and I don’t believe in extravagance.</p>

<p>And how he did love poseys, most of all the English
violets! We had a big bed of ’em, and he always
had a bunch of ’em in his little buttonhole, and be
a-pinnin’ ’em to my waist and Alice’s. And he would
have a big bunch in his hand, and jest bury his face
in ’em, as if he wuz tryin’ to take in their deep,
sweet perfume through his pores as it wuz. And
always a little, low vase that stood before his plate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
on the table would be full of ’em.</p>

<p>I wondered at it some, but found out that before
he wuz born his sweet Ma had jest sech a passion
for ’em, and always had her room full of ’em. And
I kinder wondered if, in some occult way, she wuz
a-keepin’ up the acquaintance with her boy by
means of that sweet and delicate language that we
can’t spell yet, let alone talkin’.</p>

<p>I d’no, nor Josiah don’t, but anyway Adrian jest
seemed to live on ’em in a certain way, as if they
satisfied some deep hunger and need in his inmost
nater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>And he would sometimes make the old-fashionedest
remarks I ever hearn, and praise himself up
jest as though he wuz somebody else. Not conceited
at all, but jest sincere and honest.</p>

<p>One day after family prayers, Josiah had been
readin’ about the New Jerusalem, and I spoze
Adrian’s curosity wuz rousted up, and sez he, “Aunt
Samantha, where is Heaven? Is it up in the sky, or
where is it?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp99" id="i_012" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“Aunt Samantha, where is Heaven? Is it up in the sky?”</p></div>
</div>

<p>And I sez, “Sometimes I have thought, Adrian,
it wuz right here all round us, if we could only see
it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I could find it?” sez he, and he
peered all round him in the old-fashionedest way I
ever see.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I spoze my pretty Mamma is there; I
guess she wants me dreadfully sometimes; I am a
very bright little boy&mdash;I am very agreeable.”</p>

<p>“But,” I sez, “that hain’t pretty for you to talk
so.”</p>

<p>“Why, Papa sez I am, and he sez I am his wise
little partner, and my Papa knows everything that
wuz ever known&mdash;he knows more than any other
man in the world.”</p>

<p>And I sez to myself, “No, he don’t. He don’t
know enough to be jest, from all I’ve hearn of his
doin’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>But I didn’t wonder that Adrian thought as he
did, or Alice either, for if there wuz ever a indulgent
and lovin’ father on earth, it wuz Martin
Smith.</p>

<p>Nothin’ wuz too good for his children. He
adored ’em, and tried to be father and mother both
to his motherless boy and girl. And money, so fur
as they wuz concerned, flowed as free as water.</p>

<p>P. Martyn didn’t stay but a few days this time,
but left the children two weeks and come back for
’em.</p>

<p>He stayed right to our house, and his eyesight,
so fur as the other relations wuz concerned, wuz
jest the same. He rode round considerable with
his children, and writ about five thousand letters,
and sent off and received about the same number
of letters and telegrams, and said and assured us
at the end of the three days he wuz there, that “it
wuz so sweet for him to have sech a perfect rest.”</p>

<p>He didn’t tell us much about what wuz in the
letters, though the last day that he wuz there he got
sech a enormous batch of ’em that he daned to explain
the meanin’ of ’em to Josiah and me, for we
both had helped him to carry ’em in. Sez he,
“There is no such thing as satisfying the masses.</p>

<p>“Now,” sez he, “I’ve built a line of trolley cars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that are the means of saving no end of time, for my
drivers, if they don’t come up to the swift schedule
time I have marked down for them, I discharge
them at once.</p>

<p>“They are economical, much cleaner and swifter
than horses, an invaluable saving of time. They are
convenient, rapid, and cheap. Now you would
think that would satisfy them, but no; because they
run through the most populous streets of the city,
and because once in awhile an accident takes place,
what do they want? They want me to add further
to the enormous expense I have already been subjected
to, and buy some fenders to prevent accidents.”</p>

<p>“Wall, hain’t you goin’ to?” sez I.</p>

<p>“No,” sez he, “I am not. If I do, they will
probably want some sashay bags to hang up in the
cars, and some automatic fans to fan them with as
they ride.” But I had been a-readin’ a sight about
the deaths them swift monsters had caused, and I
sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Martin, life is dear, and it seems as if every
safeguard possible ort to be throwed round the
great public, between ’em and death.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “it is impudent in them to demand
anything further than what I’ve already done.
Horses were always causing accidents.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<p>“Wall,” sez I, “when folks are in danger of
death, it makes ’em impudent. Why, Deacon Garvin
sassed the minister when he fell into the pond
at a Sunday School picnic, and the minister told
him to call on the Lord in his extremity.”</p>

<p>He sassed him and yelled out to him, “You dum
fool, you, throw me a board!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_016" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p>He sassed him and yelled out, “You dum fool, you, throw me a board!”</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Sez I, “Dretful danger makes folks sassy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t be to the expense of getting
them,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I mildly, “You told Josiah Allen and me
yesterday that you’d laid up two millions of dollars
sence you had gone into this enterprise. Now, as
a matter of justice, don’t you think that the public
who have paid you two millions of their money
have a right to demand these safeguards to life and
limb?”</p>

<p>He waived off the question.</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “in all the last year there have
not been more than fifty lives lost in our city from
these cars, and considering the hosts that have been
carried, considering the convenience, the swiftness,
the rapidity, and etcetera&mdash;what is fifty lives?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_018" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">It depends on whose lives they be.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “it depends on whose lives they
be. Now I know,” sez I, a-glancin’ at my pardner’s
shinin’ bald head a-risin’ up like a full harvest
moon from behind the pages of <i>The World</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know one life that if it went down in darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
under them wheels, it would make the hull
world black and empty. It would take all the
happiness and hope and meanin’ out of this world,
and change it into a funeral gloom.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It would darken the world for all who
love him.” And sez I, “Every one of them fifty
that have gone down under them death chariots
have left ’em who loved ’em. Hearts have ached
and broken as they have looked at the mangled
bodies and the emptiness of life faced ’em.” Sez
I, “Them rollin’ billows of blackness have swept
over the livin’ and the lovin’ every time them cruel
wheels have ground a bright human life to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“They have mostly been children,” sez I, “and
think of the anguish mother hearts have endured,
and father love and pride&mdash;how it has been crushed
down under the rollin’ wheels of death.</p>

<p>“Sometimes a father, who wuz the only prop of
a family, has gone down. How cold the world is
to ’em when the love that wropped ’em round
has been tore from ’em! Sometimes a mother&mdash;what
can take the place of mother love to the
little ones left to suffer from hunger, and nakedness,
and ignorance?”</p>

<p>“You’re imaginative, Cousin Samantha,” said he;
but I kep’ right on onbeknown to me.</p>

<p>“Who will care for the destitute children left
alone in the cold world with no one to care for ’em
and help ’em?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give ’em some money,” said little Adrian,
who’d been leanin’ up aginst my knee and listenin’
to our talk, with his big, earnest eyes fixed on
our faces.</p>

<p>“I’ll give ’em the gold piece that papa gave me
yesterday.”</p>

<p>He had gin him a twenty dollar gold piece, for I
see it.</p>

<p>“I’ll give ’em all I’ve got&mdash;I’ll work for that
poor woman who lost her little boy&mdash;I’ll work for
her and help her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Who’ll work for me?” sez Martin. “You’re
to be my partner, my boy; remember that.
You’re my little partner now&mdash;half of all I own
belongs to you.”</p>

<p>“And I will give it all to them,” sez Adrian.</p>

<p>But Martin went right on&mdash;“You are to be
president of this company when I am an old man;
you’re to work for me.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll work for those poor people, papa,” sez
Adrian, and as he said this he looked way off
through his father’s face, as he sot by the open
window, to some distance beyend him. And his
eyes, jest the color of that June sky, looked big
and luminous.</p>

<p>“I’ll work for them, papa,” and as he spoke a
sudden thrill, some like electricity, only more riz
up like, shot through my soul, a sudden and deep
conviction that he would work for ’em&mdash;that he
would in some way redeem the old Smith name
from the ojium attachin’ to it now as a owner of
them Herod’s Chariots and a Massacreer of Innocents.
But to resoom.</p>

<p>All the next day Adrian kep’ talkin’ about it,
how he wuz goin’ to be his papa’s pardner, and how
he wuz a-goin’ to work for poor folks who had
lost their little children, and wanted so many
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>And the questions he asked me about ’em, and
about poor folks, though wearisome to the flesh,
wuz agreeable to the sperit.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin called him so much from day
to day&mdash;“My little partner,” that we all got
into the habit on’t, and called him so through the
day.</p>

<p>And every evenin’ he would come to me and
say&mdash;“Good-night, Aunt Samantha, good-bye till
mornin’.”</p>

<p>And I would kiss him earnest and sweet, and say
back to him, “Good-night, little pardner, till mornin’.”</p>

<p>And after he went home, Josiah and I would
talk about him a sight, and wonder what the little
pardner wuz doin’, and how he wuz lookin’ from
day to day. And I would often go into the
parlor, where his picter stood on the top shelf of
the what-not, and stand and look dreamily at it.
There he wuz in his little black velvet suit and a
big bunch of English violets pinned on one side.
The earnest eyes would look back at me dretful
tender like and good. The mouth that held that
wonderful sweet and sort o’ curous expression, as
if he wuz thinkin’ of sunthin’ beautiful that we
didn’t know anything about, would sort o’ smile
back at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>And he seemed to be a-sayin’ to me, as he said
that day a-lookin’ out into the clear sky&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ll work for them poor people!”</p>

<p>And I answered back to him out loud once or
twice onbeknown to me, and sez I, “I believe you
will, little pardner.”</p>

<p>And Josiah asked me who I wuz a-talkin’ to.
He hollered out from the kitchen.</p>

<p>And I sez, “Ahem&mdash;ahem,” and kinder coughed.
I couldn’t explain to my pardner jest how I felt, for
I didn’t know myself hardly.</p>

<p>Wall, it run along for some time&mdash;Martin a-writin’
to me quite often, always a-talkin’ about his
little pardner and Alice, and how they wuz a-gittin’
along, and a-invitin’ us to visit ’em.</p>

<p>And at last there came sech a pressin’ invitation
from Alice to come and see ’em that I had to succumb.</p>

<p>But little, little did I ever think in my early
youth, when I ust to read about Solomon’s Temple
and Sheba’s Splendor, and sing about Pleasures and
Palaces, that I should ever enter in and partake of
’em.</p>

<p>Why, the house that Martin lived in wuz a sight,
a sight&mdash;big as the meetin’-housen at Jonesville
and Loontown both put together, and ornamented
with jest so many cubits of glory one way, and jest
so many cubits of grandeur another. Wall, it wuz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
sunthin’ I never expected to see on earth, and in
another sphere I never sot my mind on seein’ carpets
that your feet sunk down into as they would
in a bed of moss in a cedar swamp, and lofty rooms
with stained-glass winders and sech gildin’s and ornaments
overhead, and furniture sech as I never see,
and statutes a-lookin’ pale with joy, to see the
lovely picters that wuz acrost the room from ’em;
and more’n twenty servants of different sorts and
grades.</p>

<p>Why, actually, Josiah and I seemed as much out
of place in that seen of grandeur as two hemlock
logs with the bark on ’em at a fashionable church
weddin’.</p>

<p>And nothin’ but the pure love I felt for them
children, and their pure love for me, made me
willin’ to stay there a minute.</p>

<p>Martin wuz good to us, and dretful glad to have
us there to all human appearance; but Alice and
Adrian loved us.</p>

<p>And I hadn’t been there more’n a few days before
I see one reason why Alice had writ me so earnest
to come&mdash;she wuz in deep trouble, she wuz in love,
deep in love with a young lawyer, one who writ for
the newspapers, too&mdash;</p>

<p>A man who had the courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> of his convictions,
and had writ several articles about the sufferin’s
of the poor and the onjustice of rich men. And
amongst the rest he had writ some cuttin’ but jest
articles about the massacreein’ of children by them
trolley cars, and so had got Martin’s everlastin’ displeasure
and hatred.</p>

<p>The young man, I found out, wuz as good as they
make anywhere; a noble-lookin’ young feller, too,
so I hearn.</p>

<p>Even Martin couldn’t say a word aginst him,
for, in the cause of Duty and Alice, I tackled him
on the subject. Sez I, “Hain’t he honest and manly
and upright?”</p>

<p>And he had to admit that he wuz, that he hadn’t
a vice or bad habit, and wuz smart and enterprisin’.</p>

<p>I held him right there with my eye till I got an
answer.</p>

<p>“But he is a fool,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Fools don’t generally write sech good
sense, Martin.”</p>

<p>Sez he wrathfully, “I knew your opinions&mdash;I expected
you’d uphold him in his ungrateful folly.</p>

<p>“But he has lost Alice by it,” sez he; “for I
never will give my consent to have him marry her.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Then you had never ort to let him come
here and have the chance to win her heart, and now
break it, for,” sez I, “you encouraged him at first,
Martin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“I know I did,” sez he&mdash;“I thought I had found
one honest man, and I had decided on giving all
my business into his hands. It would have been
the making of him,” sez he; “but he has only
himself to blame, for if he had kept still he would
have married Alice, but now he shall not.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Alice thinks jest as he duz.”</p>

<p>“What do women know about business?” he
snapped out, enough to take my head off.</p>

<p>“If wimmen don’t know anything about bizness,
Martin, I should think you’d be glad to
know, in case you left Alice, that she and her immense
fortune wuz in the hands of an honest man.</p>

<p>“And I want you to consent to this marriage,”
sez I, “in a suitable time&mdash;when Alice gits old
enough.”</p>

<p>“I won’t consent to it!” sez he&mdash;“the writer of
them confounded papers never shall marry my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Why,” sez I, “there’s nothin’ harsh in the articles.”
Sez I, “They’re only a strong appeal to the
pity and justice of ’em who are responsible for all
this danger and horrow!”</p>

<p>“Well,” sez he, “I’ve made up mind, and I never
change it.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I d’no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> whether you will or not.” Sez
I, “This is a strange world, Martin, and folks
are made to change their minds sometimes onbeknown
to ’em.”</p>

<p>Wall, I didn’t stay more’n several days after
this, when I returned to the peaceful precincts of
Jonesville and my (sometimes) devoted pardner,
and things resoomed their usual course.</p>

<p>But every few days I got communications from
Martin’s folks. Alice writ to me sweet letters of
affection, wherein I could read between the lines a
sad background of Hope deferred and a achin’
heart.</p>

<p>And Adrian writ long letters to me, where the
spellin’ left much to be desired, but the good feelin’
and love and confidence in ’em wuz all the most
exactin’ could ask for.</p>

<p>And occasionally Martin would write a short line
of a sort of hurried, patronizin’ affection, and the
writin’ looked so much like ducks’ tracts that it
seemed as if our old drake would have owned up
to ’em in a law suit.</p>

<p>But Josiah and me would put on our strongest
specks, and take the letter between us, and hold it
in every light, and make out the heft on it.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_027" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Josiah and me put on our strongest specks.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Till at last, one notable day, long to be remembered,
there come a letter in Martin’s awful chirography.
And when we had studied out its contents,
we looked at each other in a astounded astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and a sort of or.</p>

<p>“Would I go to Europe with him and his children
as his guest?” He thought Alice seemed to be a
little delicate, and mebby the trip would do her
good, and he also thought she needed the company
of some good, practical woman to see to her, and
mother her a little.</p>

<p>That last sentence tugged at my heart strings.</p>

<p>But my answer went back by next mail&mdash;</p>

<p>“I wuz afraid of the ocean, and couldn’t leave
Josiah.”</p>

<p>The answer come back by telegraph&mdash;</p>

<p>“The ocean wuz safer than land, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> take Josiah
along, too. He expected he would go.”</p>

<p>Then I writ back&mdash;“I never had been drownded
on dry land, and didn’t believe I should be, and
Josiah didn’t feel as though he could leave the
farm.”</p>

<p>Then Martin telegrafted to Thomas J.&mdash;</p>

<p>“Arrange matters for father and mother to take
trip. Send bill to me. Alice needs their care. Her
health and happiness depend on it.”</p>

<p>So he got Thomas Jefferson on his side. Thomas
J. and Maggie loved Alice like a sister. But there
wuzn’t any bill to send to Martin, for Thomas J.
pinted out the facts that Ury could move right
into the house and take care of everything. And
sez he, “The trip and the rest will do you both
good.”</p>

<p>“But the danger,” sez I.</p>

<p>And he said, jest like Martin&mdash;“Less danger than
the land, better rates of insurance given,” etc., etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>And Maggie put in too, and Josiah begun to
kinder want to go.</p>

<p>And we wavered back and forth, until a long letter
from Alice, beggin’ me and her Uncle Josiah to
go with her to take care of her, tottled the balance
over on the side of Europe.</p>

<p>And Josiah and I began to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> preperations for
a trip abroad.</p>

<p>Oh my heart! think on’t!</p>

<p>I announced our decision to Martin in a letter of
9 pages of foolscap&mdash;Josiah writ half of it&mdash;describin’
our doubts and delays and our final reasons for
decision.</p>

<p>And he telegrafted back&mdash;</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;start 14th. Send bill of expense to
me.”</p>

<p>But there wuzn’t no bill sent, as I said&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>I guess we didn’t want nobody to buy clothes for
us&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>As for the travellin’ expenses of the trip, seein’
they thought we wuz necessaries to their comfort,
and seein’ he’d invited us, and seein’ his
income wuz about ten thousand dollars an hour,
why we laid out to let him have his way in
that.</p>

<p>It wuzn’t nothin’ that we’d ever thought on, and
then, as I told Josiah, we could even it up some
by invitin’ the children to stay all summer with us
next year.</p>

<p>So the die wuz cast down, and the cloth wuz
soon bought for Josiah’s new European shirts, and
my own foreign nightcap and nightgown.</p>

<p>As for my clothes, by Maggie’s advice <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>and assistance,
aided by our two practical common senses,
the work wuz soon completed.</p>

<p>Maggie said that I must dress better than I usually
did on my towers, for the sake of pleasin’ Martin
and Alice. And she and Thomas J. made me a
present of a good black silk dress, and she see to
makin’ it, with one plain waist for common wear,
and one dressy waist, very handsome, with black
jet trimmin’ on it for my best.</p>

<p>A good gray alpacky travellin’ dress, some the
color of dust, with a bunnet of the same color, and
a good brown lawn for hot days wuz enough, and
didn’t take up much room. Plenty of good underclothes
and a wool wrapper for the steamer completed
my trossow.</p>

<p>Thomas J. see to it that his Pa had a good-lookin’
suit of black clothes for his best, and a suit of
pepper and salt for every day.</p>

<p>I also made him 2 new flannel nightcaps. And
I myself had two new nightcaps made. In makin’
’em, I departed from my usual fashion of sheep’s-head
nightcaps, thinkin’ in case of a panick at sea,
and the glare of publicity a-bein’ throwed onto ’em,
a modified sheep’s head would appear better than
clear sheep.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>It wuz very dressy when it wuz done.</p></div>
</div>

<p>They wuz gathered slightly in the crown, and had
some very nice egin’
on ’em&mdash;7 cents per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
yard at hullsail&mdash;7 and
&frac12; retail.</p>

<p>It wuz good lace.</p>

<p>They wuz very becomin’
to my style.</p>

<p>I also made Josiah
a handsome dressin’-gown
out of a piece
of rep goods I had in
the house. I had laid
out to cover a lounge
with it, but I thought
under these peculiar
circumstances Josiah
needed it more’n the lounge did, and so I made it
up for him. I made a cord with two tossels
to tie it with. I twisted the cord out of good
red and black woosted and made the tossels of
the same.</p>

<p>It wuz very dressy when it wuz done. And he
would have worn it out visitin’ if I had encouraged
him in it. He wuz highly delighted and tickled
with it.</p>

<p>But I tutored him that it wuz only to wear in his
state-room, and in case of a panick on deck.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">A HEATHEN MISSIONARY.</p>

<p>Wall, I wuz a-settin’ in my clean settin’-room
on a calm twilight, engaged in completin’ my preperations&mdash;in
fact, I wuz jest a-puttin’ the finishin’
touches on one of Josiah’s nightcaps and mine.</p>

<p>I put cat stitch round the front of hisen, a sort
of a dark red cat.</p>

<p>When all to once I hearn a knock at the west
door. I had thought as I wuz a-settin’ a-sewin’
what a beautiful sunset it wuz. The west jest
glowed with light that streamed over and lit up the
hull sky. All wuz calm in the east, and a big
moon wuz jest risin’ from the back of Balcom’s
Hill. It wuz shaped a good deal like a boat, and I
laid down my sheep’s-head nightcap and set still
and watched it, as it seemed moored off behind the
evergreens that stood tall and silent and dark,
as if to guard Jonesville and the world aginst the
gold boat that wuz a-sailin’ in from some onknown
harbor. But it come on stiddy, and as if it had
to come.</p>

<p>I felt queer.</p>

<p>And jest at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> minute I hearn the knock at the
west door.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp54" id="i_034" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A dark figger that riz up like a strange
picter aginst the sunset.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And I went and opened it, and as I did the west
wuz flamin’ so with light that it most blinded me at
first; but when I got my eyesight agin I see
a-standin’ between me and that light a dark figger
that riz up like a strange picter aginst the sunset.</p>

<p>His back wuz to the light, and his face wuz in
the shadder, but I could see that it wuz dark
and eager, with glowin’ eyes that seemed to light
up his dark features, some as the stars light up
the sky.</p>

<p>And he wuz dressed in a strange garb, sech as I
never see before, only to the World’s Fair. Yes,
in that singular moment I see the value of travel.
It give me sech a turn that if I hadn’t had the advantage
of seein’ jest such costooms at that place,
I should most probble have swooned away right
on my own doorstep.</p>

<p>He wuz dressed in a long, loose gown of some
dark material, and had a white turban on his head.
Who he wuz or where he come from was a mystery
to me.</p>

<p>But I felt it wuz safe anyway to say, “Good-evenin’,”
whoever he wuz or wherever he came
from; he couldn’t object to that.</p>

<p>So consequently I said it&mdash;not a-knowin’ but he
would address me back in Hindoo, or Sanskrit, or
Greek, or sunthin’ else paganish and queer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>But he didn’t; he spoke jest as well as my
Thomas Jefferson could, and when I say that, I
say enough,
full enough
for anybody,
only his voice
had a little
bit of a foreign
axent to
it, that put
me in mind
some of the
strange odor
of Maggie’s
sandal-wood
fan, sunthin’
that is inherient
and stays
in it, though
it is owned
in America,
and has Jonesville wind in it&mdash;good, strong wind,
as good as my turkey feather fan ever had.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Good-evening, madam. Do I address
Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Sez he, “Pardon this intrusion. I come on particular
business.”</p>

<p>Whereupon I asked him to come in, and sot a
chair for him.</p>

<p>I didn’t know whether to ask him to lay off his
things or not, not a-seein’ anything only the dress
he had on, and not knowin’ what the state of his
clothes wuz.</p>

<p>And after a minute’s reflection on it, I dassent
venter.</p>

<p>So I simply sot him a chair and asked him to set.</p>

<p>He bowed dretful polite, and thanked me, and
sot.</p>

<p>Then there wuz a slight pause ensued and follered
on. I wuz some embarrassed, not knowin’
what subject to introduce.</p>

<p>Deacon Bobbett had lost his best heifer that day,
and most all Jonesville wuz a-lookin’ for it, but I
didn’t know whether it would interest him or not.</p>

<p>And Sally Garvin had a young babe. A paper
of catnip even then reposed on the kitchen table
a-waitin’ until her husband come back to send it,
but I didn’t know whether that subject would be
proper to branch out on to a man.</p>

<p>So I sot demute for as much as half a minute.</p>

<p>And before I could collect myself together and
break out in conversation, he sez in that deep, soft,
musical voice of hisen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Madam, I have come on a strange errand.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, in a encouragin’ voice, “I am
used to strange errents&mdash;yes, indeed, I am! Why,”
sez I, “this very day a woman writ to me from
Minnesota for money to fence in a door-yard, and,”
sez I, “Sime Bentley wuz over bright and early
this mornin’ to borrer a settin’ hen. He had plenty
of eggs, but no setters.”</p>

<p>Sez I in a encouragin’ axent, for I couldn’t help
likin’ the creeter, “I am used to ’em&mdash;don’t be
afraid.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know but he wuz after my nightgown
pattern, and I looked clost at his garb; but I see
that it wuz fur fuller than mine and sot different.
The long folds hung with a dignity and grace that
my best mull nightgown never had, and if it wuz
so, I wuz a-goin’ to tell him honorable that his pattern
went fur ahead of mine in grandeur.</p>

<p>And then, thinks I, mebby he is a-goin’ to beg
for money for a meetin’-house steeple or sunthin’ in
Hindoostan, and I wuz jest a-makin’ up my mind
to tell him that we hadn’t yet quite paid for the
paint that ornamented ourn. And I wuz a-layin’
out to bring in some Bible and say, “Charity begun
on our own steeple.”</p>

<p>But jest as I wuz a-thinkin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> this he spoke up in
that melodious voice, that somehow put me in mind
of palm trees a-risin’ up aginst a blue-black sky,
and pagodas, and oasises, and things. Sez he,
“Will you allow me to tell you a little of my
history?”</p>

<p>I sez, “Yes, indeed! I am jest through with my
work.” Sez I frankly, “I have been finishin’ some
nightcaps for my pardner, and I sot the last stitch
to ’em as you come in. I’d love to set still and hear
you tell it.”</p>

<p>So I sot down in the big arm-chair and folded
my arms in a almost luxurious foldin’, and listened.</p>

<p>Sez he, “My name is Al Faizi, and I am come
from a country far away.” And he waved his hand
towards the east.</p>

<p>Instinctively I follered his gester, and his eyes,
and I see that the gold boat of the moon had come
round the pint, and wuz a-sailin’ up swift into the
clear sky. But a big star shone there, it stood
there motionless, as he went on.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I have always been a learner, a seeker
after truth. When a small boy I lived with my
uncle, who was a learned man, and his wife, who was
an Englishwoman. From her I learned your language.
I loved to study; she had many books.
She was the daughter of a missionary, who died and
left her alone in that strange land. My uncle was
a convert to her faith. She married him and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
happy. She had many books that belonged to her
father; he was a good man and very learned; he
did my people much good while he lived with
them.</p>

<p>“I learned from those books many things that
our own wise men never taught me, and from them
I got a great craving to see this land. I learned
from these books and my aunt’s teachings taught
me when I was so young that truth permeated my
being and filled my heart, that this land was the
country favored by God&mdash;this land so holy, that it
sent missionaries to teach my people. Then I went
to a school taught by English teachers, but always
I searched for truth&mdash;I search for God in mosque
and in temple. These books said God is here in
this land. So I come. Many of my people come
to this great Fair, I come also with them.</p>

<p>“But always I seek the great spirit of God I
came here to find. I thought truth and justice
would fill your temples, and your homes, and all
your great cities.</p>

<p>“I come, I watch for this Great Light&mdash;I listened
for the Great Voice, I see strange things, but
I say nothing, I only think, but I get more and
more perplexed. I ask many people to show me
the temple where God is, to show me the great
mosque where Truth and Right dwell, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
people are blessed by their white shining light, for
I thought He would be in all the customs and
ways of this wise people, so good that they instruct
all the rest of the world. I come to learn, to worship,
but I see such strange things, such strange
customs. I see cruelties practised, such as my own
people would not think of doing. I keep silent, I
only think&mdash;think much. But more and more
I wonder, and grow sad.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">I don’t love to hear that; that sounds bad.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I ask many men, preachers, teachers, to show
me the place where God is, the great palace
where truth dwells. They take me to many places,
but I do not find the great spirit of Love <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>I seek
for. I find in your big temples altars built up to
strange gods.”</p>

<p>Sez I mildly, “I don’t love to hear that; that
sounds bad. I can take you to one meetin’-house,”
sez I, “where we don’t have no Dagon nor snub-nosed
idols to worship,” sez I.</p>

<p>But even as I spoke my conscience reproved me;
for wuz there not settin’ in the highest place in that
meetin’-house a rich man who got all his money by
sellin’ stuff that made brutes of his neighbors?</p>

<p>What wuz we all a-lookin’ up to, minister and
people, but a gold beast! What wuz that man’s
idol but Mammon!</p>

<p>And then didn’t I remember how the hull meetin’-house
had turned aginst Irene Filkins, who went
astray when she wuz nothin’ but a little girl, a
motherless little girl, too?</p>

<p>Where wuz the great sperit of Love and Charity
that said&mdash;“Neither do I condemn thee; go and
sin no more”? Wuz God there?</p>

<p>Didn’t I remember that in this very meetin’-house
they got up a fair to help raise money for some
charity connected with it, and one of the little girls
kicked higher than any Bowery girl? Wuz it
a-startin’ that child on the broad road that takes
hold on death? Wuz we worshippin’ a idol of Expediency&mdash;doing
evil that good might come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>There wuz poor ones in that very meetin’-house,
achin’ hearts sufferin’ for food and clothin’ almost, and
rich, comfortable ones who went by on the other side
and sot in their places and prayed for the poor, with
their cold forms and hungry eyes watchin’ ’em vainly
as they prayed, hopin’ for the help they did not get.</p>

<p>Wuz we hyppocrites? Did we bow at the altar
of selfishness?</p>

<p>Truly no Eastern idol wuz any more snub-nosed
and ugly than this one.</p>

<p>I wuz overcome with horrow when I thought it
all over, and sez I&mdash;“I guess I won’t take you there
right away; we’ll think on’t a spell first.”</p>

<p>For I happened to think, too, that our good, plain
old preacher, Elder Minkley, wuzn’t a-goin’ to
preach there Sunday, anyway, but a famous sensational
preacher, that some of the rich members
wanted to call. Yes, many hed turned away from
the good gospel sermons of that man of God, Elder
Minkley, and wanted a change.</p>

<p>Wuz it a windy, sensational God set up in our
pulpit? I felt guilty as a dog, for I too had criticised
that good old Elder’s plain speakin’.</p>

<p>Al Faizi had sot me to thinkin’, and while I wuz
a-meditatin’ his calm voice went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“I came to a city not far away; there I saw some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
words you had written. I felt that you, too, desired
the truth. I have come to ask you if you have
found it&mdash;if you have found in this land the place
where Love and Justice reign, and to ask you
where it is, that I, too, may worship there, and teach
the truth to my people.”</p>

<p>I wuz overcome by his simple words, and I bust
out onbeknown to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hain’t found it.” Sez I, and onconsciously
I used the words of another&mdash;“‘We are all poor
creeters,’ but we try to worship the true God&mdash;we
try to follow the teachin’s of Him who loved us,
and give His life to us.”</p>

<p>“The wise man who lived in Galilee and taught
the people?” sez he.</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “not the wise man, but the Divine
One&mdash;the God who left His throne and dwelt with
us awhile in the form of the human. We try to
foller His teachings&mdash;a good deal of the time we
do,” sez I, honestly and sadly.</p>

<p>For more and more this strange creeter’s words
sunk into my heart, and made me feel queer&mdash;queer
as a dog.</p>

<p>“I have read His words. I loved Him when a
boy, I love Him still. I go into your great
churches sacred to His name. I find in one grand
church they say He is there alone, and not in any
other. I go into another, just as great, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
say He is there, and not in the one I first visited;
and then I go to another, and another, and yet
another.</p>

<p>“All have different ways and beliefs. All say
God is here within the narrow walls of this church,
and not in the others. Oh! I get so confused, I
know not what to do. How can I, a poor stranger,
trace His footsteps through all these conflicting
creeds? I grow sad, and my heart fills with doubt
and darkness. Well I remember His words that I
had pondered in my heart when a boy&mdash;‘That they
who loved Him should bear the cross and follow
Him,’ and love and care for His poor. In all these
great, beautiful churches I hear sweet music. In
some I see grand pictures, and note the incense
floating up toward the Heavens; in some I see high
vaulted roofs, and the light in many glowing colors
falls on the bowed forms of the worshippers. I hear
holy words, the voice of prayer, but I see no
crosses borne, and all are rich and grand. I go
down in the low places. I see the poor toiling on
unpitied and uncared for. I see these rich people
worship in the churches one day, and pray&mdash;‘Grant
us mercy as we are merciful to others.’</p>

<p>“And then the next day they put burdens on the
poor, so hard that they can hardly bear them, the
poor, starving, dying, herded together like animals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
in wretched places unfit for dumb creatures.</p>

<p>“And ever the rich despise the poor, and the
poor curse the rich&mdash;both bitter against each other,
even unto death.</p>

<p>“I find no God of Love in this.</p>

<p>“I go into your great halls where laws are made&mdash;I
see the wise men making laws to bind the weak
and tempted with iron chains&mdash;laws to help bad
men lead lives of impurity&mdash;laws to make legal
crimes that your Holy Book says renders one forever
unfit for Heaven. I find no God of Justice in
this.”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “He hain’t nigh ’em, and never
wuz!”</p>

<p>“Well then,” sez he, “why do they not find out
the way of truth themselves before they try to
teach other people?”</p>

<p>“The land knows!” sez I; “I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Some of your teachers do much good,” sez he;
“they are good, and teach some of my people good
doctrines. But why ever are they permitted by
your government to bring ways and habits into our
land that cover it with ruin?</p>

<p>“I was walking once with my own relation, Hadijah,
unconverted, and we found one of our people
lying drunken by the wayside, with bottles of American
whiskey lying by his side. ‘Boston’ was marked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
on them, a city, I find, that considers itself the centre
of goodness and lofty thought. The bottles were
empty. Hadijah says to me&mdash;‘That man is a
Christian.’</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="i_045" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
  <p>“<span class="smcap">‘That man is a Christian.’ ‘How do you know?’ ‘Because
he is drunk.’</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I said&mdash;‘No, I think not.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes he is,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘How do you know it?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Because he is drunk.’ Hadijah, not being yet
converted, and judging from appearances and from
the evidences of his eyesight, associated the ideas
and thought that in some way drunkenness was an
evidence of Christianity. That belief is largely
shared by all heathen people.</p>

<p>“And then I open your Holy Book and find it
written, ‘No drunkard shall inherit eternal life,’
and I say to myself, What does it mean that these
holy people over the seas, who try so hard to convert
us, should send whiskey, and Bibles, and missionaries
to us all packed in one great ship?”</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“The nation don’t mean to do it.” Sez I,
“It don’t want to do any sech harm.”</p>

<p>“But I hear of the great power of this nation,
could it not prevent it? If it could not prevent
it, it must be a weak government indeed. And if
truly this great country is so weak and so wicked as
to set snares for the heathens&mdash;trying to lead them
into paths that end in eternal ruin&mdash;I think why not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
keep their missionaries in their own land? They
must need them even more than we do.”</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“Don’t talk so, poor creeter, don’t talk so.
Missionaries go out to your land fired with the
deathless zeal to save souls&mdash;to bring the knowledge
of the Christ to all the world.”</p>

<p>“But if they bring the knowledge in the way I
speak of, so the heathen honestly believes drunkenness
is the sign of Christianity, is it not making a
mockery of what they profess to teach?”</p>

<p>I wuz dumbfoundered. I didn’t know how to
frame a reply, and so I sot onframed, as you may
say.</p>

<p>“I heard the missionaries say, and I read it in
your Holy Book, that the liar shall have his portion
in the lake that burns forever. The same
curses are on them that steal and on them that
commit adultery.</p>

<p>“I thought the country that sends these missionaries,
rebuking these sins so sharply&mdash;I
thought their country must be pure and peaceable
and holy in its ways. I come here, as I say, seeking
the Great Light to guide me. I come here to hear
the Great Voice, so I could go back and carry its
teachings to our own people. For I thought there
must be some mistake, and that the lessons failed in
some way to carry the idea of your great government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
So I come, I study; and I find that not
only was your great government willing to have my
poor people enslaved by the drink habit, but it was
a partaker in it. It sent over the accursed whiskey
and brandy and took a portion of the pay&mdash;a portion
of the money spent by my poor people for
making themselves unfit for earth, and shutting
them forever out of Heaven.</p>

<p>“Again, this law that ‘Thou shalt not commit
adultery,’ that stands out so plain in the Holy Book,
that divorce is only permitted for this one cause, I
find this great government, which by its laws breaks
even the holy marriage bonds by the committing of
this sin&mdash;I find that this government makes this sin
easy and convenient to commit. It grants licenses
to make it lawful and right.</p>

<p>“When I get here and study I see such strange
things. Forevermore I wonder, and forevermore
I say&mdash;Why are not missionaries sent to this people,
who do such things?</p>

<p>“And I, even I, so weak as I am and so ignorant,
but fired as I am by the love of Christ Jesus&mdash;I say
to myself, ‘I will tell this people of their sins. I
will try to bring them to a knowledge of the pure
and holy religion of Christ.’”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<p>“You come as a missionary, then?” sez I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
a-bustin’ out onbeknown to me. “Often and often
I have wanted a heathen to come over and try to
convert Uncle Sam&mdash;poor old creeter, a-wadin’ in
sin up to his old knee jints and over ’em,” sez I.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp57" id="i_049" style="max-width: 30em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam a-wadin’ in sin up to his old knee jints.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Uncle Sam?” sez he; “I know him not. I
meant your great people; I do not speak of one
alone.”</p>

<p>“I know,” sez I; “that is what we call our
Goverment when we are on intimate terms with
it.”</p>

<p>“And,” sez I, “you little know what that old
man has been through. He wants to do right&mdash;he
honestly duz; but you know jest how it is&mdash;how
mistaken counsellors darken wisdom and confound
jedgment.”</p>

<p>But the sweet, melodious voice went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your missionaries preach loud to my people
against the sins of stealing and gambling.</p>

<p>“But I find that in this country great places
are fitted up for gambling and theft.”</p>

<p>Truly he spoke plain, but then I d’no as I could
blame him.</p>

<p>“In these places of theft and gambling, called
your stock exchanges, I find that you have people
called brokers, and some wild animals called bulls
and bears, though for what purpose they are kept
I know not, unless it is that they are trained for
the Arena. I know not yet all your customs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“But this I know, that your brokers gamble and
steal from the people&mdash;sometimes millions in one
day. Which money, taken from the common
people all over this country, is divided by these
brokers amongst a few rich men. Perhaps then the
game of bulls and bears, fighting each other for
their amusement, begins. I know not yet all your
ways.</p>

</div>

<p>“But I know that in one day five million
bushels of wheat were bought and sold when there
was no wheat in sight&mdash;when even during that whole
year the crop amounted to only two hundred and
eighty millions. There were more than two million,
two hundred thousand bushels of wheat bought
and paid for that never grew&mdash;that were not ever in
the world.</p>

<p>“As I saw this, oh! how my heart burned to
teach this poor sinful people the morality that our
own people enjoy.</p>

<p>“For never were there such sins committed in
our country.</p>

<p>“I find your rich men controlling the market&mdash;holding
back the bread that the poor hungered and
starved for, putting burdens on them more grievous
than they could bear. These rich men, sitting
with their soft, white hands, and forms that never
ached with labor, putting such high prices on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>grain and corn that the poor could not buy to
eat&mdash;these rich men prayed in the morning (for
they often go through the forms of the holy
religion)&mdash;they prayed, ‘Give us this day our
daily bread,’ and then made it their first business
to keep people from having that prayer answered
to them.</p>

<p>“They prayed, ‘Lead us not into temptation,’
and then deliberately made circumstances that they
knew would lead countless poor into temptation&mdash;temptation
of theft&mdash;temptation of selling Purity
and Morality for bread to sustain life.”</p>

<p>Sez I, a-groanin’ out loud and a-sithin’ frequent&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to hear sech talk, it kills me almost;
and,” sez I honestly, “there is so much truth
in it that it cuts me like a knife.”</p>

<p>Sez he, a-goin’ on, not mindin’ my words&mdash;“I
felt that I must warn this people of its sins. I
must tell them of what was done once in one of
our own countries,” sez he, a-wavin’ his hand in a
impressive gester towards our east door&mdash;</p>

<p>“In one of our countries the authorities learned
that stock exchanges were being formed at Osaka,
Yokohama, and Koba.</p>

<p>“The police, all wearing disguises, went at once
to the exchanges and mingled with the crowd.
When all was ready a sign was given, the police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
took possession of the exchanges and all the books
and papers, the doors were locked and the prisoners
secured. Over seven hundred were put in prison,
the offence being put down&mdash;‘Speculation in margins.’</p>

<p>“I yearn to tell this great people of the way of
our countries, so that they may follow them.”</p>

<p>“A heathen a-comin’ here as a missionary!” sez
I, a-thinkin’ out loud, onbeknown to me. “Wall, it
is all right.” Sez I, “It’s jest what the country
needs.”</p>

<p>But before I could say anythin’ further, at that
very minute my beloved pardner come in.</p>

<p>He paused with a look of utter amazement. He
stood motionless and held complete silence and two
pails of milk.</p>

<p>But I advanced onwards and relieved him of his
embarrassment and one pail of milk, and introduced
Al Faizi. Al Faizi riz up to once and made
a deep bow, almost to the floor; but my poor Josiah,
with a look of bewilderment pitiful to witness,
and after standin’ for a brief time and not speakin’
a word, sez he&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_055" style="max-width: 30em;">

<p>“I guess, Samantha, I will go out to the sink

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>Truly, it wuz enough to surprise any man, to
leave a pardner with no companion but a sheep’s-head
nightcap, partly finished, and come back in
a few minutes and see her a-keepin’ company with
a heathen, clothed in a long robe and turban.</p>

<p>Wall, Josiah asked me out into the kitchen for
a explanation, which I gin to him with a few
words and a clean towel, and then sez I&mdash;“We
must ask him to stay all night.”</p>

<p>And he sez, “I d’no what we want of that
strange-lookin’ creeter a-hangin’ round here.”</p>

<p>And I sez, “I believe he is sent by Heaven to
instruct us heathens.”</p>

<p>And Josiah said that if he wuz sent from
Heaven he would most probble have wings.</p>

<p>He didn’t want him to stay, I could see that, and
he spoke as if he wuz on intimate terms with angels,
a perfect conoozer in ’em.</p>

<p>But I sez, “Not all of Heaven’s angels have
wings, Josiah Allen, not yet; but,” sez I, “they
are probble a-growin’ the snowy feathers on ’em
onbeknown to ’em.”</p>

<p class="h2sub">OFF INTO SIDE PATHS.</p>

<p>Wall, the upshot of the matter wuz Al Faizi
stayed right there for weeks. He seemed to have
plenty of money, and I d’no what arrangement he
and Josiah did make about his board, but I know
that Josiah acted after that interview with him in
the back yard real clever to him, and didn’t say a
word more aginst the idee of his not bein’ there.</p>

<p>(Josiah is clost.)</p>

<p>As for me, I would have scorned to have took a
cent from him, feelin’ that I got more’n my pay out
of his noble but strange conversation.</p>

<p>But Josiah is the head of the family (or he calls
himself so).</p>

<p>And mebby he is some of the time.</p>

<p>But suffice it to say, Al Faizi jest stayed and
made it his home with us, and peered round, and
took journeys, and tried to find out things about
our laws and customs.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson loved to talk with him the
best that ever wuz. And Al Faizi would make
excursions to different places round, a-walkin’ mostly,
a-seein’ how the people lived, and a-watchin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
their manners and customs, and in writin’ down
lots of things in some books he had with him,
takin’ notes, I spozed, and learnin’ all he could.
One book that he used to carry round with him
and make notes in wuz as queer a lookin’ book as
I ever see.</p>

<p>With sunthin’ on the cover that looked some like
a cross and some like a star.</p>

<p>There wuz some precious stuns on it that flashed.
If it wuz held up in some lights it looked like a
cross, and then agin the light would fall on’t and
make it look like a star. And the gleamin’ stuns
would sparkle and flash out sometimes like a sharp
sword, and anon soft, like a lambient light.</p>

<p>It wuz a queer-lookin’ book; and he said, when I
atted him about it, that he brought it from a
country fur away.</p>

<p>And agin he made that gester towards the East,
that might mean Loontown, and might mean Ingy
and Hindoosten&mdash;and sech.</p>

<p>After that first talk with me, in which he seemed
to open his heart, and tell what wuz in his mind, as
you may say, about our country, he didn’t seem to
talk so very much.</p>

<p>He seemed to be one of the kind who do up
their talkin’ all to one time, as it were, and git
through with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Of course he asked questions a sight, for he
seemed to want to find out all he could. And he
would anon or oftener make a remark, but to talk
diffuse and at length, he hardly ever did. But he
took down lots of notes in that little book, for I
see him.</p>

<p>I enjoyed havin’ him there dretful well, and done
well by him in cookin’, etcetery and etcetery.</p>

<p>But the excitement when he first walked into the
Jonesville meetin’-house with Josiah and me wuz
nearly rampant. I felt queer and kinder sheepish,
to be walkin’ out with a man with a long dress, and
turban on, and sandals. And I kinder meached along,
and wuz glad to git to our pew and set down as
quick as I could. But Josiah looked round him
with a dignified and almost supercilious mean. He
felt hauty, and acted so, to think that we had a
heathen with us and that the other members of the
meetin’-house didn’t have one.</p>

<p>But if I felt meachin’ over one heathen, or, that is,
if I felt embarrassed a-showin’ him off before the
bretheren and sistern, what would I felt if Josiah had
had his way about comin’ to meetin’ that day?</p>

<p>Little did them bretheren and sistern know what
I’d been through that mornin’.</p>

<p>Josiah wore his gay dressin’-gown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> down to breakfast,
which I bore well, although it wuz strange&mdash;strange
to have two men with dresses on a-settin’
on each side of me to the table&mdash;I who had always
been ust to plain vests and pantaloons and coats
on the more opposite sex.</p>

<p>But I bore up under it well, and didn’t say nothin’
aginst it, and poured out the coffee and passed the
buckwheat cakes and briled chicken and etc. with a
calm face.</p>

<p>But when church-time come, and Ury brought
the mair and democrat up to the door, and I got up
on to the back seat, when I turned and see Josiah
Allen come out with that rep dressin’-gown on,
trimmed with bright red, and them bright tossels
a-hangin’ down in front, and a plug hat on, you
could have knocked me down with a pin feather.</p>

<p>And sez I sternly, “What duz this mean, Josiah
Allen?”</p>

<p>Sez he, “I am a-goin’ to wear this to meetin’, Samantha.”</p>

<p>“To meetin’?” sez I almost mekanically.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he; “I am a-doin’ it out of compliments
to Fazer; he would feel queer to be the only
man there with a dress on, and so I thought I would
keep him company; and,” sez he, a-fingerin’ the tossels
lovin’ly, “this costoom is very dressy and becomin’
to me, and I’d jest as leave as not let old
Bobbett and Deacon Garvin see me appearin’ in it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
sez he.</p>

<p>“Do you go and take that off this minute, Josiah
Allen! Why, they’d call you a idiot and as crazy as
a loon!”</p>

<p>Sez he, a-puttin’ his right foot forward and standin’
braced up on it, sez he, “I shall wear this dress
to meetin’ to-day!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You won’t wear it, Josiah Allen!”</p>

<p>Sez he, “You know you are always lecturin’ me
on bein’ polite. You know you told me a story
about a woman who
broke a china teacup
a purpose because one
of her visitors happened
to break hern.
You praised her up to
me; and now I am
actin’ out of almost pure
politeness, and you
want to break it up, but
you can’t,” sez he, and
he proceeded to git into
the democrat.</p>

<p>Ury wuz a-standin’
with his hands on his
sides, convulsed with laughter, and even the mair
seemed to recognize sunthin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> strange, for she
whinnered loudly.</p>

<p>Sez I in frigid axents, “Even the old mair is a
whinnerin’, she is so disgusted with your doin’s,
Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>“The old mair is whinnerin’ for the colt!” sez he,
and agin he put his foot on the lowest step.</p>

<div class="figright illowp65" id="i_061" style="max-width: 20em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>Sez I, a-risin’ up in the democrat, “I’ll git out.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, a-risin’ up in the democrat, with
dignity, “I’ll git out and stay to home. I will not
go to church and see my pardner took up for wearin’
female’s clothin’.”</p>

<p>He paused with his foot on the step, and a shade
of doubt swept over his liniment.</p>

<p>“Do you spoze they would?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Of course they would!” sez I; “twilight would
see you a-moulderin’ in a cell in Loontown.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t moulder much in half a day!” sez he.</p>

<p>But I see that I wuz about to conquer. He paused
a minute in deep thought, and then he turned away;
but as he went up the steps slowly, I hearn him say&mdash;“Dum
it all, I never try to show off in politeness
or anything but what sunthin’ breaks it up!”</p>

<p>But anon he come down clothed in his good
honorable black kerseymeer suit, and Al Faizi soon
follered him in his Oriental garb, and we proceeded
to meetin’.</p>

<p>As I say, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> excitement wuz nearly rampant as
we went in. And I spoze nothin’ hendered the
female wimmen and men from bein’ fairly prostrated
and overcome by their feelin’s, only this fact,
that the winter before a Hindoo in full costoom
had lectured before the Jonesville meetin’-house,
so that memory kinder broke the blow some. And
then some on ’em had been to the World’s Fair,
and seen quantities of heathens and sech there.</p>

<p>So no casuality wuz reported, though feather
fans wuz waved wildly, and more caraway wuz consoomed,
I dare presoom to say, than would have
been in a month of Sundays in ordinary times.</p>

<p>But while the wonder and curosity waxed rampant
all round, Al Faizi sot silent and motionless
as the dead, with his soft, brilliant eyes fixed on the
minister’s face, eager to ketch every word that fell
from his lips&mdash;a-tryin’ to hear the echo of the Great
Voice speak to him through the minister’s words,
so I honestly believe.</p>

<p>For I think that a honester, sincerer, well-meanin’er
creeter never lived and breathed than he wuz;
and as days went on I see nothin’ to break up my
opinion of him.</p>

<p>Politer he wuz than any female, or minister, I
ever see fur or near. Afraid of makin’ trouble to a
marked extent, eager and anxious to learn everything
he could about everything&mdash;all our laws, and
customs, and habits, and ways of thinkin’&mdash;and tellin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
his views in a simple way of honest frankness, that
almost took my breath away&mdash;anxious to learn, and
anxious to teach what he knew of the truth.</p>

<p>Though, as I said, after that first bust of talk with
me he seemed inclined to not talk so much, but
learn all he could. It wuz as if he had his say out
in that first interview. Dretful interestin’ creeter
to have round, he wuz&mdash;sech a contrast to the inhabitants
of Jonesville, Deacon Garvin and the
Dankses, etc.</p>

<p>He didn’t stay to our house all the time, as I said,
but would take pilgrimages round and come back,
and make it his home there.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz jest about this time that a contoggler
come to our house to contoggle a little for me.
I wanted some skirts, and some underwaists, and
some of Josiah’s old clothes contoggled.</p>

<p>You know, it stood to reason that we couldn’t
have all new things for our voyage, and so I had to
have some of our old clothes fixed up. You see,
things will git kinder run down once in awhile&mdash;holes
and rips in dresses, trimmin’ offen mantillys,
tabs to new line, and pantaloons to hem over round
the bottom, and vests to line new, and backs to put
into ’em, and etcetery and etcetery.</p>

<p>And, then, you’ll outgrow some of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> things,
and have to let ’em out; or else they’ll outgrow you,
and you’ll have to take ’em in, or sunthin’.</p>

<p>Sech cases as these don’t call for a dressmaker or
a tailoress. No, at sech times a contoggler is
needed. And I’ve made a stiddy practice for years
of hirin’ a woman to come to the house every little
while for a day or two at a time, and have my
clothes and Josiah’s all contoggled up good.</p>

<p>This contoggler I had now wuz a old friend of
mine, who had made it her home with me for some
time in the past, and now bein’ a-keepin’ house
happy not fur away, had sech a warm feelin’ for me
in her heart, that she always come and contoggled
for me when I needed a contoggler.</p>

<p>She had a dretful interestin’ story. Mebby you’d
like to hear it?</p>

<p>I hate to have a woman meander off into
side paths too much, but if the public are real
sot and determined on hearin’ me rehearse her history,
why I will do it. For it is ever my desire to
please.</p>

<p>It must be now about three years sence I had
my first interview with my contoggler. And I see
about the first minute that she wuz a likely creeter&mdash;I
could see it in her face.</p>

<p>She wuz a perfect stranger to me, though she
had lived in Jonesville some five months prior and
before I see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>And Maggie, my son’s, Thomas Jefferson’s, wife,
hearn of her through her mother’s second cousin’s
wife’s sister, Miss Lemuel Ikey. And Miss Ikey
said that she seemed to be one of the best wimmen
she ever laid eyes on, and that it would be a
real charity to give her work, as she wuz a stranger
in the place, without much of anything to git along
with, and seemed to be a deep mourner about sunthin’.
Though what it wuz she didn’t know, for
ever sence she had come to Jonesville she had made
a stiddy practice of mindin’ her own bizness and
workin’ when she got work.</p>

<p>She had come to Jonesville kinder sudden like,
and she had hired her board to Miss Lemuel Ikey’s
son’s widow, who kep’ a small&mdash;a very small boardin’-house,
bein’ put to it for things herself though,
likely.</p>

<p>I told Maggie to ask her mother to ask her
second cousin’s wife to ask her sister, Miss Lemuel
Ikey, to ask her son’s wife what the young woman
could do.</p>

<p>And the word come back to me straight, or as
straight as could be expected, comin’ through five
wimmen who lived on different roads.</p>

<p>“That she wuzn’t a dressmaker, or a mantilly
maker, or a tailoress. But she stood ready to do
what she could, and needed work dretfully, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
would be awful thankful for it.”</p>

<p>Then feelin’ deeply sorry for her, and wantin’ to
befriend her, I sent word back in the same way&mdash;“To
know if she could wash, or iron, or do fancy
cookin’. Or could she make hard or soft soap?
Or feather flowers? Or knit striped mittens? Or
pick geese? Or paint on plaks? Or do paperin’?”</p>

<p>And the answer come back, meanderin’ along
through the five&mdash;“That she wuzn’t strong enough,
or didn’t know how to do any one of these, but she
stood ready to do all she could do, and needed work
the worst kind.”</p>

<p>Then I tackled the matter myself, as I might
better have done in the first place, and went over to
see her, bein’ willin’ to give her help in the best way
any one can give it, by helpin’ folks to help themselves.</p>

<p>I went over quite early in the mornin’, bein’ on
my way for a all-day’s visit to Tirzah Ann’s.</p>

<p>But I found the woman up and dressed up slick,
or as slick as she could be with sech old clothes on.</p>

<p>And I liked her the minute I laid eyes on her.</p>

<p>Her face, though not over than above handsome,
wuz sweet-lookin’, the sweetness a-shinin’ out
through her big, sad eyes, like the light in the
western skies a-shinin’ out through a rift in heavy
clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Very pale complected she wuz, though I couldn’t
tell whether the paleness wuz caused by trouble, or
whether she wuz made so. And the same with her
delicate little figger. I didn’t know whether that
frajile appearance wuz nateral, or whether Grief
had tackled her with his cold, heavy chisel, and had
wasted the little figger until it looked more like a
child’s than a woman’s.</p>

<p>And in her pretty brown hair, that kinder waved
round her white forward, wuz a good many white
threads.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn’t tell but what white hair run
through her family&mdash;it duz in some. And I had
hearn it said that white hair in the young wuz a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
sign of early piety, and of course I couldn’t set up
aginst that idee in my mind.</p>

<p>But them white hairs over her pale young face
looked to me as if they wuz made by Sorrow’s
frosty hand, that had rested down too heavy on her
young head.</p>

<p>She met me with a sweet smile, but a dretful sad
one, too, when Miss Ikey introduced me.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_068" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>She met me with a sweet smile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But when I told my errent she brightened up
some. But after settin’ down with her for more’n a
quarter of a hour, a-questionin’ her in as delicate
a way as I could and get at the truth, I found that
every single thing that she could do wuz to contoggle.</p>

<p>So I hired her as a contoggler, and took her
home with me that night on my way home from
Tirzah Ann’s as sech, and kep’ her there three
weeks right along.</p>

<p>I see plain that she could do that sort of work by
the first look that I cast onto her dress, which wuz
black, and old and rusty, but all contoggled up
good, mended neat and smooth, and so I see, when
she got ready to go with me, wuz her mantilly, and
her bunnet; both on ’em wuz old and worn, but
both on ’em showed plain signs of contogglin’.</p>

<p>She wuz a pitiful-lookin’ little creeter under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> her
black bunnet, and pitiful-lookin’ when the bunnet wuz
hung up in our front bedroom, and she kep’ on bein’
so from day to day, as pale and delicate-lookin’ as a
posey that has growed in the shade&mdash;the deep shade.</p>

<p>And though she kep’ to work good, and didn’t
complain, I see from day to day the mark that Sufferin’
writes on the forwards of them that pass
through the valleys and dark places where She
dwells. (I don’t know whether Sufferin’ ort to be
depictered as a male or a female, but kinder think
that it is a She.)</p>

<p>But to resoom. I didn’t say nothin’ to make her
think I pitied her, or anything, only kep’ a cheerful
face and nourishin’ provisions before her from day
to day, and not too much hard work.</p>

<p>I thought I’d love to see her little peekéd face git
a little mite of color in it, and her sad blue eyes a
brighter, happier look.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t. She would work faithful&mdash;contoggle
as I have never seen any livin’ woman contoggle,
much as I have witnessed contogglin’.</p>

<p>And I don’t mean any disrespect to other contogglers
I have had when I say this&mdash;no, they did the
best they could. But Miss Clark (that wuz the
name she gin&mdash;Annie Clark), she had a nateral gift
in this direction.</p>

<p>She worked as stiddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> as a clock, and as patient,
and patienter, for that will bust out and strike every
now and then. But she sot resigned, and meek,
and still over rents and jagged holes in garments,
and rainy days and everything.</p>

<p>Calm in thunder storms, and calm in sunshine,
and sad, sad as death through ’em all, and most
as still.</p>

<p>And I sot demute and see it go on as long as I
could, a-feelin’ that yearnin’ sort of pity for her that
we can’t help feelin’ for all dumb creeters when
they are in pain, deeper than we feel for talkative
agony&mdash;yes, I always feel a deeper pity and a more
pitiful one for sech, and can’t help it.</p>

<p>And so one day, when I wuz a-settin’ at my knittin’
in the settin’-room, and she a-settin’ by me sad
and still, a-contogglin’ on a summer coat of my Josiah’s,
I watched the patient, white face and the slim,
patient, white fingers a-workin’ on patiently, and I
stood it as long as I could; and then I spoke out
kinder sudden, being took, as it were, by the side
of myself, and almost spoke my thoughts out loud,
onbeknown to me, and sez I:</p>

<p>“My dear!” (She wuzn’t more’n twenty-two at
the outside.)</p>

<p>“My dear! I wish you would tell me what makes
you so unhappy; I’d love to help you if I could.”</p>

<p>She dropped her work, looked up in my face sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
o’ wonderin’, yet searchin’.</p>

<p>I guess that she see that I wuz sincere, and
that I pitied her dretfully. Her lips begun to tremble.
She dropped her work down onto the floor,
and come and knelt right down by me and put her
head in my lap and busted out a-cryin’.</p>

<p>You know the deeper the water is, and the thicker
the ice closes over it, the greater the upheaval and
overflow when the ice breaks up.</p>

<p>She sobbed and she sobbed; and I smoothed back
her hair, and kinder patted her head, and babied her,
and let her cry all she wanted to.</p>

<p>My gingham apron wuz new, but it wuz fast color
and would wash, and I felt that the tears would
do her good.</p>

<p>I myself didn’t cry, though the tears run down
my face some. But I thought I wouldn’t give way
and cry.</p>

<p>And this, the follerin’, is the story, told short
by me, and terse, terser than she told it, fur. For
her sobs and tears and her anguished looks all punctuated
it, and lengthened it out, and my little groans
and sithes, which I groaned and sithed entirely onbeknown
to myself.</p>

<p>But anyway it wuz a pitiful story.</p>

<p>She had at a early age fell in love voyalent with
a young man, and he visey versey and the same.
They wuz dretful in love with each other, as fur <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>as
I could make out, and both on ’em likely and well
meanin’, and well behaved with one exception.</p>

<p>He drinked some. But she thought, as so many
female wimmen do, that he would stop it when they
wuz married.</p>

<p>Oh! that high rock that looms up in front of
prospective brides, and on which they hit their
heads and their hearts, and are so oft destroyed.</p>

<p>They imagine that the marriage ceremony is
a-goin’ in some strange way to strike in and make
over all the faults and vices of their young pardners
and turn ’em into virtues.</p>

<p>Curous, curous, that they should think so, but
they do, and I spoze they will keep on a-thinkin’
so. Mebby it is some of the visions that come in
the first delerium of love, and they are kinder crazy
like for a spell. But tenny rate they most always
have this idee, specially if love, like the measles,
breaks out in ’em hard, and they have it in the old-fashioned
way.</p>

<p>Wall, as I wuz a-sayin’, and to resoom and proceed.</p>

<p>Annie thought he would stop drinkin’ after they
wuz married. He said he would. And he did for
quite a spell. And they wuz as happy as if they
had rented a part of the Garden of Eden, and wuz
a-workin’ it on shares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Then his brother-in-law moved into the place,
and opened a cider-mill and a saloon&mdash;manafactered
and sold cider brandy, furnished all the
saloons round him with it, took it off by the load
on Saturdays, and kep’ his saloon wide open, so’s
all the boys and men in the vicinity could have
the hull of Sunday to git crazy drunk in, while he
wuz a-passin’ round the contribution-box in the
meetin’-house.</p>

<p>For he wuz a strict church-goer, the brother-in-law
wuz, and felt that he wuz a sample to foller.</p>

<p>Wall, Ellick Gurley follered him&mdash;follered him
to his sorrer. The brother-in-law employed him in
his soul slaughter-house&mdash;for so I can’t help callin’
the bizness of drunkard-makin’. I can’t help it,
and I don’t want to help it.</p>

<p>And so, under his influence, Ellick Gurley wuz
led down the soft, slippery pathway of cider drunkenness,
with the holler images of Safety and old
Custom a-standin’ up on the stairway a-lightin’ him
down it.</p>

<p>Ellick first neglected his work, while his face
turned first a pink, and then a bloated, purplish red.</p>

<p>Then he begun to be cross to his wife and abusive
to little Rob, the beautiful little angel that had
flown to them out of the sweet shadows of Eden,
where they had dwelt the first married years of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>their life.</p>

<p>Finally, he got to be quarrelsome. Annie wuz
afraid of him. And all of his money and all of
hern went to buy that cider brandy (it makes the
ugliest, most dangerous kind of a drunk, they say,
of any kind of liquor, and I believe it from what
I have seen myself, and from what Annie told me
of her husband’s treatment of her and little
Rob).</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_075" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Finally, he got to be quarrelsome.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And at last she begun to suffer for food and
clothin’ for herself and the child.</p>

<p>And as the drink demon riz up in Ellick’s crazy
brain, and grew more clamorous in its demands,
and he weaker to contend aginst it, Ellick sold
all of the household stuff he could git holt of to
appease this dretful power that had got holt of him,
body and soul.</p>

<p>Annie took in all the work she could do, did
washin’ for the neighbors, who ust to envy her
her happiness and prosperity&mdash;rubbed and hung
out the heavy garments with tremblin’ fingers&mdash;sewed
with her achin’ head a-bendin’ over the long
seams, and her tear-filled eyes dimmed with the
pain of unavailin’ agony.</p>

<p>But heartaches and abuse made her weak form
weaker and weaker, and then there wuz but little
work to do, if she had been as strong as Sampson;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
so, bein’ fairly drove to it by Agony, and
Fear, and Starvation, them three furies a-drivin’
her, as you may say, harnessed up three abreast
behind her, a-goadin’ her weak, cowerin’ form with
their fire-tipped lashes, she appealed to the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>She told him, what he knew before, that she and
little Robbie were starvin’, and she wuz afraid of
her life, and she urged him to not sell Ellick any
more of the poison that wuz a-destroyin’ him.</p>

<p>He wuz to meetin’ when she went. He
wuz dretful particular about his religious observances.</p>

<p>No Hindoos wuz ever stricter about burnin’
their widders on the funeral pyre of the departed
than he wuz a-follerin’ up what he called his religion.</p>

<p>(Religion, sweet, pure sperit, how could she stand
it, to have him a-burnin’ his incense in front of
her? But, then, she has had to stand a good deal
in this old world, and has to yet.)</p>

<p>But, as I wuz a-sayin’, there never wuz a Pharisee
in old or modern times that went ahead of him in
cleanin’ the outside of his platters and religious
deep dishes, and makin’ broad the border of his
phylakricy. Why, his phylakricy wuz broader and
deeper than you have any idee on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>But inside of his platters and deep dishes wuz
dead men’s bones!</p>

<p>More’n one quarrel, riz up out of his accursed
brandy, had led to bloodshed, besides achin’ and
broken hearts without number, and ruined souls
and lives.</p>

<p>And his phylakricy ort to be broad, for it had to
be used as a pall time and agin, and it covered, so
he thought, a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Wall, as I say, he wuz to a church meetin’.
There wuz a-goin’ to be a Association of Religious
Bodies for the Amelioration of Human Woe. And
he wuz anxious to be sent as a delegate, so he hung
on to the last, and wuz appinted.</p>

<p>But finally he got home, and Annie tackled
him on the subject nearest her heart, talked to
him with tears in her eyes and a voice tremblin’
with the anguished beatin’s of her poor, achin’
heart.</p>

<p>She begged him to not sell her husband any
more drink, begged him for her sake and for the
sake of little Rob. For she knew that if the man
had a tender place in his heart it wuz for his little
nephew. He did love him deeply, or as deep as a
man like this could love anything above his money
and his reputation as a religious leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>But he wouldn’t promise, and he acted dretful
high-headed and hateful to her to cover up his
meanness, for he felt that if he should refuse to sell
his stuff, it would not only stop his money-makin’,
but it would be like ownin’ up that he had been in
the wrong.</p>

<p>And he plumed himself, and carried the idee that
cider wuz a healthful beverage, and very strengthenin’
in janders and sech. Why, he carried the
idee to the world, and mebby in the first place he
did to his own soul, so blindin’ is the spectacles of
selfishness that he wore, that he wuz a-doin’ a
charitable work a-keepin’ that old cider-mill and
saloon a-goin’.</p>

<p>So he wouldn’t pay no attention to her pleadin’s,
only acted hateful and cross to her, his guilty conscience
makin’ him so, I spoze.</p>

<p>And then, too, he wuz in a hurry, for his church
duties wuz a-waitin’ for him, and his barrels of cider
wanted doctorin’ with alcohol and sech.</p>

<p>So he turned onto his heel and left her.</p>

<p>And Annie went home more broken-hearted than
ever, for his cold, cruel sneers and scorn hurt her on
the poor heart made sore by her husband’s brutality.</p>

<p>And Ellick went on worse than ever. And it
wuz on that very day that his brother-in-law (and
to make it shorter we will call him B. I. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>L.)&mdash;it
wuz on the very day that the B. I. L. went to New
York on his great Amelioratin’ Human Misery
errent, that Ellick, crazy drunk with cider shampain,
struck little Rob sech a blow that it knocked the
child down, and he laid stunted for more’n a hour.
And he threatened Annie that he would take her
life, because she interfered between him and the boy.</p>

<p>He raved round, like the maniac that he wuz. He
said that he would throw her out doors if she didn’t
git a good dinner, when there wuzn’t a mite of
food in the house to cook. He raved about the
house bein’ so freezin’ cold, when there wuzn’t a
stick of wood nor a lump of coal.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp73" id="i_080" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Ellick lay drunk in the office.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And finally he reeled off to his usual place of
resort. And while the B. I. L. wuz a-raisin’ up in
the great meetin’-house, and a-smoothin’ out his
phylakricy, and a-layin’ the border of it careful, so’s
it would show off well, and then bustin’ out into
sech a speech, on the duties of church-members to
the sinful and the sorrowin’ round ’em&mdash;a speech
that riz him up powerful in religious circles&mdash;Ellick
lay drunk in the office of his cider-mill.</p>

<p>Little Rob lay like a dead child in a cold, bare
room, and a white-faced, half-starved mother bent
over him with big, despairin’, anxious eyes&mdash;bent
over him till life come back to his poor,
bruised body; and then as darkness crept over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
earth she stole away, a-carryin’ him in her arms.</p>

<p>She got a ride with a passin’ teamster, got carried
fur off, then got another ride, wuz fed and warmed
by pityin’ hearts on the way; so she come to a
place nigh Jonesville, onbeknown to anybody.</p>

<p>When Ellick rousted up out of his drunken
sleep he went back to a desolate, empty house. His
surprise, his grief, sobered him. He flew to the
B. I. L., woke him out of a sound sleep filled with
visions of his triumphs.</p>

<p>The B. I. L. wuz in a tryin’ place. He wuz
about to be riz up to a high position in the meetin’-house.
If this story got out, it might and probble
would hurt him. Annie must be found and
brought back. They jined forces to try to find her.
They sot out that very day, but the quest wuz a
long one.</p>

<p>Annie stayed a spell with the family who took
her in first out of the cold and the darkness.</p>

<p>The man of the house, and the woman, too, wuz
relations on the soul side to the good old Samaritan
mentioned in Skripter. They did well by her.</p>

<p>But little Rob never got over the effects of the
cruel blow, and the fall on the hard floor, and the
awful journey through the coldness of the midnight
escape. They all sort o’ underminded his little constitution,
and he wuz took sick a bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>And bein’ too tired out and hardly dealt with
here on earth, he wuz promoted up to that higher
home, where we may be sure that his True Father,
the Helper of all the oppressed and burdened, accepted
him right into His great heart of Love, and
wuz good to the little, patient soul.</p>

<p>Wall, Annie couldn’t tell me much about that
time, when she had to let the child, a part of her
own life, go out of her arms, and she wuz left
alone&mdash;alone amongst strangers, helpless, despairin’,
and poor.</p>

<p>No, she couldn’t talk much about it, not in words,
but I understood the language of her tremblin’ lips
and her fallin’ tears.</p>

<p>Wall, when little Rob wuz laid away under the
dead grasses and the bare shade trees of that little
country church-yard, Annie couldn’t stay long in
the house where he had been and now wuz not.</p>

<p>His little figger hanted every room, and her agonized
Remembrance wuz a-walkin’ up and down
with her. So she heard of a place in Jonesville
where mebby she could git work, and she come
there.</p>

<p>But lately news had come to her that her husband
and B. I. L. wuz huntin’ for her.</p>

<p>Ellick really and truly loved his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> wife and child,
so it wuz spozed, and hunted for Love’s and Anxiety’s
sakes.</p>

<p>The B. I. L. hunted ’em so’s to hush up the
story; it wuz a-hurtin’ him dretfully in the eyes of
the meetin’-house. And Anger and Selfishness and
Hypocrocy wuz a-holdin’ up their blue-flamed
torches to light him on his hunt.</p>

<p>Wall, Annie wuz in deathly fear that they
would find her. She had took another name&mdash;her
mother’s maiden name&mdash;but she wuz afraid they
would find it out.</p>

<p>She said that she could not live to go through
agin what she had gone through with. And yet
when I pinned her right down on the subject (a
calm, religious pinnin’) she owned up that she did
love her husband yet. She cried when she said it.</p>

<p>And I thought to myself that I would cry if
I wuz in her place, if I loved such a thing as that.</p>

<p>But she said, and mebby it wuz so, that he would
have been all right if it hadn’t been for the influence
of the B. I. L. and his bein’ gradual led back into
drinkin’ agin by sunthin’ that he thought wouldn’t
hurt him. She said that he never would have
touched whiskey agin, havin’ promised and broke
off.</p>

<p>But he thought, somehow, that the liquid sech a
highly religious man wuz a-sellin’ under the name of
cider must be sort o’ soothin’ to his insides; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>but instead
of that it set fire to ’em, and his morals and
all, and burnt ’em right up.</p>

<p>Annie showed me Ellick’s picter, and it wuz a
good-lookin’ face, or kinder good; it would have
been handsome if it hadn’t been for a sort of a weak
look onto it.</p>

<p>But weak or strong, she loved him. And so I
didn’t really know how she wuz a-comin’ out so fur
as her own happiness wuz concerned. Wimmen are
so queer.</p>

<p>But I chirked her up all I could, told her to keep
jest as calm as she could conveniently, and I would
take care of her for the present.</p>

<p class="h2sub">SAMANTHA’S SWORD OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE.</p>

<p>Wall, if you’ll believe it, it wuz the very
next day I had a occasion to go to Jonesville
for some necessaries; and Josiah wuz busy a-makin’
a new stanchil in the barn, so I sot off alone
after breakfast with a large pail of good butter, and
a cross-cut saw that Josiah had sent down to be
filed, and the mair.</p>

<p>Wall, jest about a mild from our house is a
old tarvern that has been fixed up and is used
now as a sort of a half-way house between Jonesville
and Loontown. Teamsters and sech stop
there a sight to git “Refreshments for man and
beast,” as the sign reads.</p>

<p>Wall, I had got most there when I see a man
approachin’ me a-walkin’ afoot. And I knew him
the first minute I sot my eyes on him.</p>

<p>It wuz Ellick Gurley.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_087" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>It wuz Ellick Gurley.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And the very minute I sot my eyes onto his
face Duty and Principle both hunched me up
hard to tackle him in this matter.</p>

<p>Wall, most probble he had been hangin’ round
for some time, for he knew me the first thing, and
he come up to the side of the democrat wagon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> I
wuz a-ridin’ in, bold as brass, and he sez:</p>

<p>“Is this Josiah Allen’s wife?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” sez I, up clear and decided.</p>

<p>“Is a woman calling herself Anna Clark at your
house?”</p>

<p>I wuzn’t a-goin’ to fight for Annie with any pewter
weepons of untruth. No, I wuz a-goin’ to fight
with the two-edged sword of Eternal Truth and
Jestice, and I took ’em out and whetted ’em (as it
were), and sez I, sharp and keen&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well,” sez he, lookin’ dretful defiant and mad at
me, “she is my wife, and I hereby forbid you harboring
her, for I will pay no debts of her contracting.”</p>

<p>“Like as not,” sez I coolly, “as you never paid
any of your own.”</p>

<p>He kinder blushed up some, but he went on
some as if he wuz a-rehearsin’ a piece he had
learnt:</p>

<p>“She has left my bed and board!”</p>

<p>Then I waved that sword of Truth agin that I had
been a-whettin’, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“It wuz her bed. Her mother gin it to her for
her settin’ out, and picked every feather in it from
her own geese and ganders. I got it from Annie’s
own lips, and you sold it for drink. As for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>boards,” sez I candidly, for even in the midst of
the fiercest battle with the forces of wrong I must
be jest to my foe, and so sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“As for the piece of board you speak of, I d’no
whose it wuz, but I believe it wuz hern. Anyway,
I know she earnt every mite of food and
drink you took into your miserable body.”</p>

<p>And the remembrance of Annie’s wrongs and
woes so overmastered me, that I sez right out&mdash;</p>

<p>“You drunken, low-lived snipe, you! how dast
you be comin’ round that good little creeter, and
tryin’ to git her back into her starvation and slavery,
and peril of life and limb? How dast you,
you drunken coot, you?” sez I, a-lookin’ two or
three daggers at him and some simeters.</p>

<p>He quailed. I d’no as I ever see signs of quail
any plainer than I see it in him.</p>

<p>But he muttered sunthin’ about&mdash;“A man’s
having a right to his wife and child.”</p>

<p>“A right?” sez I; “do you dast to look anybody
in the face and talk of your right to wife and child,
when it wuz your poor, abused, half-starved wife’s
weak arms and mighty love that riz up between
you and your child and murder? Riz up between
you and the gallows?”</p>

<p>He quailed deeper, fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> deeper than he had
quailed, and his lips trembled.</p>

<p>And I see under the quail, come to look clost at
him, that there wuz a kinder good-hearted look under
all the weakness and dissipated look of his face.
I see, or thought I see, that it wuz bad influences
that had led him astray, and if he had kep’ under
good influence and away from bad ones (the B. I. L.
and his hard cider, etc.), I thought like as not,
from the generous lay of his features, that he
might have been a tolerable good-lookin’ feller and
behaved middlin’ well.</p>

<p>And that is why I spozed that Annie looked so
heart-broken, that wuz why, I spoze, that, in spite of
all she had underwent, my contoggler loved him.</p>

<p>But anon he sprunted up some and said sunthin’
about bein’ bound to have his wife.</p>

<p>And I waved my sword of Jestice agin (mentally)
and sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, I am bound that you shan’t have her, and
you’ll see,” sez I, “who’ll carry the day!”</p>

<p>And then he sez, “What right have you to interfere?
What relation are you to her?”</p>

<p>And sez I, a-liftin’ up my head in a very noble
way&mdash;“The same relation that the Samaritan wuz
to the man by the wayside. She’s my relation on
the heart’s side, the Pity and Sympathy’s side.
Closter ties than the false, shaky ones that bound
her to a life of slavery and danger with you&mdash;bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
her to you, who promised to protect her, and then
half-murdered her. And you’ll find out so!” sez
I, a-lookin’ as bold as brass, but in my heart
I quaked considerable, not knowin’ but I wuz a-goin’
agin the hull statute and constitution and by-laws
of the U. S. of America.</p>

<p>But I spoze my mean skairt him. It had sech
determination and courage into it, and he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will go and call my brother-in-law. He is a
rich and respectable man and very religious. I will
bring him to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Wall, do so!” sez I, bold as a lioness on the
outside. “I’d love to set my eyes onto that creeter,
jest out of curosity, jest as I would look at a menagerie
of wild beasts and man-eaters.”</p>

<p>So he went back into the tarvern and brung him.</p>

<p>He wuz a mean-lookin’ creeter in his face,
and he wuz short in statter, and his figger looked
sort o’ sneakin’ under the weight of guilt he wuz
a-carryin’ round under the cloak of religion.</p>

<p>And his little black eyes looked guilty, and his hull
face, under some kinder red hair, looked withered
and hardened, as if his doin’ for years what he knew
wuz wicked had hardened his face into a cruel meanness.
He looked mean as mean could be.</p>

<p>But he tried to hold his head up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> and he bust out
the first thing about takin’ the law to me!</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> take the law to me! <i>you!</i>”</p>

<p>And oh! how my simeter of Truth and Jestice
jest flashed round that man’s short, meachin’ figger.</p>

<p>“You take the law on anybody, you mean creeter
you! who have brung all this sin and misery to
pass for your own selfishness. You, who took the
good-tempered, weak boy and poured your poison
down his throat till you flooded out all his moral
sense and husbandly and fatherly affection, and filled
up the empty space with the demons of Hatred and
Brutality and crazy quarrelin’s!</p>

<p>“You talk of law, who stole away every mite of
that poor girl’s happiness and every cent of her
money for your cursed drink!</p>

<p>“You, who drove out of their home the sweet
angel of Happiness, who used to board with ’em
stiddy, and drove in your beasts of prey!</p>

<p>“You ruined her happiness, you starved her, you
broke her heart, and now you want her back to torment
her agin!</p>

<p>“Wall, you won’t have her, unless you take her
over my prostrate form!”</p>

<p>The B. I. L. wuz half skairt to death, and he
stood demute.</p>

<p>But Ellick broke in with tremblin’ lips. He
stopped talkin’ about Annie for a spell, bein’, I
spoze, perfectly overcome by my eloquence. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>And
he begun on another tack, and sez he in tremblin’
axents&mdash;</p>

<p>“I want my boy,” sez he, “I will have my child!”</p>

<p>And I see that he did have a deathly longin’ and
hungry look in his eyes. I could see that he did
love his wife and child, deep and earnest. And I
felt a little mite tenderer towards him, not much,
for I kep’ a-thinkin’ of how Annie’s face had looked
as she come and throwed herself at my feet.</p>

<p>The memory of that white face and them big, anguished
eyes riz my heart up and kep’ it from meltin’
right down under the agony of that man’s look.</p>

<p>The B. I. L., whose selfishness had done the
hull work, he too looked a heartfelt anxiety about
the boy. I see that he loved him too, and wuz
proud of him.</p>

<p>But, as I say, the memory of the Giant Wrong that
had struck down Annie and the boy stood right by
me and nerved me up, and I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“You can’t have the child!”</p>

<p>Then Ellick flared right up, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will have the child, and I’ll let you know that
I will! I am his natural guardian, and I’ll let you
know that the law is on my side, and I can take him,
and I will take him!”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “you can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> take him!”</p>

<p>“He can!” sez the B. I. L., speakin’ up sharp as
a meat-axe&mdash;“he can; nobody loves the child as well
as we do; and he is the child’s natural guardian,
and we can take him away from any place you have
put him in.”</p>

<p>And agin I sez, “No you can’t, not from the place
he is in now. The boy has got another gardeen now,
a better one.”</p>

<p>“Another guardian!” sez the father; “well, I will
tear him right out of his hands; I will make him
give him up!”</p>

<p>He wuz jealous as a dog, I could see, of the gardeen.</p>

<p>“No you won’t!” sez I.</p>

<p>“Yes he will!” sez the B. I. L.; “we’ll teach
him what the law is, and that a father can get his
boy every time!”</p>

<p>“Not this time!” sez I; “this gardeen is powerful
and kind, too; and he has got him in a safe
place. He wuz misused and kicked and beaten
and half starved; but he has enough now; he has
got a home of plenty and rest and happiness. He
is safe,” sez I.</p>

<p>“No matter how safe it is we will have him right
out of it!” sez the B. I. L.</p>

<p>“He is my child, and I <i>will</i> have him!” says
Ellick Gurley.</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> can’t have him. You can’t
pull that tender little body out of the grave to misuse
it agin. You can’t draw the sweet little sperit
out of God’s happy home to torment it agin. The
Lord is his father and his gardeen now, and He
will keep the boy!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried the B. I. L., and he staggered
back like a drunken man, and his face turned white
as a bleached white cotton shirt.</p>

<p>“Dead! my baby dead!” sez Ellick Gurley.
“Then I am his murderer!”</p>

<p>And he threw up his arms as if he had received a
pistol shot right in his heart, and then he fell jest
like a log right down in the road. Wall, I disembarked
from my democrat, and by the time the
B. I. L. had got him up in a more settin’ poster on a
log by the side of the road, I wuz by him a-holdin’
his head and a-chafin’ his hands and his forward.</p>

<p>When he come to and riz up and sot upright, his
first words wuz&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh! poor Annie! poor girl! how did she bear
it, all alone with our dead boy! Oh! my boy!
my boy that I killed!”</p>

<p>I see plain that there wuz good in the man, after
all.</p>

<p>But the B. I. L. had by this time sprunted up,
and wuz a-thinkin’ of his phylakricy, and a-pullin’ it
over himself and Ellick, and seemed anxious to sort
o’ hush him up, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t your doings, it wasn’t the accident
that killed the boy, it was probably something else.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, lookin’ at the B. I. L. straight in
the face&mdash;“yes, it <i>wuz</i> sunthin’ else, it wuz <i>you</i>!
You smooth-faced, selfish hyppocrite, you; it wuz
your doin’s that killed the boy! If you had left his
Pa alone, and not led him into a condition fit to
murder, jest to put a few cents into your own
pocket, the boy would have been alive and happy
to-day, and so would Ellick and Annie.” Sez I,
“It wuz your doin’s, and you don’t want to forgit
it!” sez I.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">Yes, it</span> <i>wuz</i> <span class="smcap">sunthin’ else; it wuz</span> <i>you</i>.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>He quailed, he quailed hard, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“You talk like a fool!”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I; “you are the fool, for it is the
fool that hath said that there is no God, and you
see there is,” sez I&mdash;“a God that punishes sin, who
is even now a-punishin’ you; a God who said,
“Cursed is he who putteth the cup to his neighbor’s
lips.” Sez I, “You have prospered and grown rich
in your bizness of beast-makin’, and you didn’t believe
there wuz Eternal Jestice a-watchin’ over your
sinful deeds, and you find now that you wuz a fool
to believe it. For you find now that there is a God.
You find now that you <i>are</i> cursed for your sin in
makin’ murderers and assassins and wife-beaters and
child-killers!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, “You loved little Rob; your bad heart is
achin’ now this minute to think it wuz your hand
that dealt out the poison that reached him through
his father’s weakness and miserable vice!”</p>

<p>He wuz demute. He didn’t say a word, but a
look come over his face that I don’t want to see
agin. He didn’t want to give up and own up his
guilt and repent, and he wuz jest crushed right down
about little Rob. He wuz jest tosted both ways,
between agony and selfishness. He didn’t want to
give up his profitable bizness of beast-makin’, and he
wuz horrow struck to think that his own little idol
had fell a victim.</p>

<p>His face looked like a humbly fallen angel’s, or
how I spoze they look. I never see one fall.</p>

<p>He didn’t say another word, but turned on his
heel and walked off.</p>

<p>The last word he said to me, as I stated heretofore,
wuz callin’ me “a fool.”</p>

<p>But I didn’t care for that. I knew I wuzn’t.</p>

<p>But still that broken-hearted father, that wretched,
lonesome husband sot there by the side of the road.
Finally he spoke&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Can I see Annie?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>
<p>“No, sir!” sez I plain and square&mdash;jest as plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>and jest as square as if my own heart wuzn’t
a-achin’, and a-achin’ hard, too, for the miserable,
broken-hearted man.</p>

<p>My tears, if they fell, and I spoze they did from
my feelin’s, fell inside of my head; for I wouldn’t
let him have a chance to misuse and torment that
good little creeter agin, not if I could help it.</p>

<p>He trembled like a popple leaf. He wuz paler
than any dish-cloth I ever see, and I see my advantage,
and I hardened my heart, some like Pharo’s,
only a more pious hardenin’, for it wuz done on
principle.</p>

<p>“You talk of wantin’ that poor girl to go back
to your cold, naked home, to hardship, to starvation,
to wretchedness&mdash;bodily wretchedness and heart
wretchedness. For she loves you still, you poor
snipe, you; she loves you, fool that she is, but
wimmen are weak.”</p>

<p>I see his face grow brighter for a minute, and
then turn pale as death agin.</p>

<p>“Will she forgive me?” sez he in axents weak as
a cat, and weaker, too, and fur hopelesser than any
cat I ever see.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it!” sez I heartlessly (on the
outside) and boldly.</p>

<p>“I’ll do better. I’ll promise her to not drink
another drop!”</p>

<p>“Promises are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>cheap,” sez I in a lofty way,
a-lookin’ up into a tree, for his pale face weakened
me, and I felt that I must be strong. So I looked
up into the tree overhead. It wuz a slippery ellum,
but I held firm.</p>

<p>“Promises are cheap and slippery,” sez I. I
spoze it wuz that tree that put me in mind of that
simely. “She shan’t be led away by ’em agin, by
my consent.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t drink for a year will you help me to
have my wife back again?”</p>

<p>His voice trembled.</p>

<p>“That is beginnin’ to talk like a human creeter,”
sez I, and I looked down from the ellum sort o’
benignantly. And I sez in a more warmer axent,
but not too warm&mdash;jest about milk warm&mdash;</p>

<p>“You stop drinkin’ for a year. You git another
home for her as good as you took her to at first,
and I’ll advise her to talk with you about goin’
back, and not one minute before!” sez I.</p>

<p>“Can I see her one minute?” sez he.</p>

<p>Annie wuz to home. Josiah wuz away. All devolved
on me, and I riz up to the occasion.</p>

<p>“No!” sez I, “you can’t; you can’t see her to-day
for a minute, or a secont!”</p>

<p>(I knew putty wuz hard in comparison to her
heart, and I wouldn’t run the resk.)</p>

<p>“You stop drinkin’ for six months,” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>sez I, “and
you may see her for one-half hour in my presence,
and not a minute longer,” sez I, as resolute as iron.
“I’ll take care of her, and when you’ve earnt the
right to have her agin with you, I’ll give her up to
you and not a minute before,” sez I&mdash;“not a minute!”</p>

<p>He riz right up, the tears runnin’ down his face,
and he ketched holt of my hand and kissed it. I
d’no when I’ve been so kinder took back.</p>

<p>But I knew that Josiah wouldn’t care on sech a
occasion as this, there wuzn’t anything immoral in
it, and I couldn’t hender it anyway, it wuz done so
quick. And then he started right off, fast as he
could go.</p>

<p>And as sure as the world, that man went to work
at his trade. Got two dollars a day. He didn’t
drink a drop. He rented a little house with five
acres of grass land round it and a paster. He
kep’ two cows, milked ’em nights and mornin’s,
sold his milk and laid up money.</p>

<p>Workin’ with all his heart and soul to be worthy
of his wife and home.</p>

<p>And I writ to that man stiddy, jest as stiddy as
though I wuz a-keepin’ company with him, every
week of my life.</p>

<p>Josiah didn’t care. Good land! I writ on duty.
I sent him good letters, all about how Annie wuz,
and how she looked, and what she said, and a-holdin’
up his arms like Arun and Hur (specially Hur,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
it sounds some like a woman).</p>

<p>She made it her home with me, but went out to
contoggle here and there, and laid up money,
bought sheets and piller-cases and sech. And I
helped her to two comforters and a bed-spread.</p>

<p>But she didn’t go back to him till the year wuz
up.</p>

<p>No, I see to that.</p>

<p>And when that year had gone by, he wuz a sober
man all the time, completely out from under the
influences of the B. I. L. and cider and whiskey
and saloons, and completely under ourn, Annie’s
and mine and Temperance. And we a-doin’ our
very best for him, and a-believin’ in him, and
a-helpin’ him, all three on us.</p>

<p>Why, then I ventered to let her go and live with
him agin. And I even made a party for ’em on
the occasion. Some like a weddin’ party, for we
all brung presents to ’em. And the children and a
few sincere well-wishers that she had contoggled
for and Josiah and me all jinin’ hearty in the
prayer Elder Minkley put up after supper for the
peace and prosperity of the new home.</p>

<p>And they’ve prospered first-rate.</p>

<p>Their sweet, cozy home is pleasant, as a home
where Love is always must be. But it is a-settin’
down under a shadder, and always will set there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
It can’t be helped.</p>

<p>The shadder stands up behind it, some like a
mountain; but the peace and happiness of the
present is gradually a-makin’ a meller, tender haze
in front on’t; some as the blue,
luminous sky of Injun Summer
floats in and softens the truth
of the year’s decay.</p>

<p>It is there, all the same, but
time and that soft, tender mist
wears off the sharp edges on’t,
and sometimes the shadders fall
some in the shape of a cross.
The sun hits it in jest the right
way.</p>

<p>Annie and Ellick jined the
meetin’-house the year after they
come together agin, and the Elder and several of
us bretheren and sistern gathered round ’em, and
held up their courage and helped ’em along all we
could.</p>

<p>And though some are kinder mean and throw
out hints, for human nater can’t be helped, and
mean and small souls have got to act out what is
inherient in ’em, and some, specially the B. I. L.
and his family, made lots of talk about him and
her, and poked fun at ’em, and acted. But Ellick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
is a-learnin’ to be patient and bear what he says
he knows is “The Wages of Sin.”</p>

<p>But, as naterally follers, he is now in the employ
of another Master, and his wages is a-comin’ in
better and better every day.</p>

<p>And wuzn’t he happy when he held another little
boy on his knee? Little Tom Josiah, named after
my two best-beloved males.</p>

<p>And Annie wanted to add “Sam” to it for me,
but I demurred, sayin’, “They didn’t seem to go
together smooth. Tom Josiah Sam didn’t seem to
have the flow and rythm to suit my melodious
idees.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Save the Sam, it may come in handy in
the futer.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowp78" id="i_102" style="max-width: 15em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">Save the Sam, it may come in handy
in the futer.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the dimpled hands of that child seemed to
draw Annie and Ellick nigher together than they’d
ever been, and pull ’em both along, onbeknown to
’em, into the sunshiny fields of happiness.</p>

<p>Thomas J. gin little Tom Josiah ten dollars to
put in the Savin’s Bank at compounded interest,
and Josiah gin him two lambs, which are a-goin’ to
be put out to double to the very best advantage for
him.</p>

<p>By the time he is twenty-one he will have considerable
money, and a big flock of sheep to drive
on before him down the path of the futer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>But I might talk for hours and hours and not
exhaust the fascinatin’ subject of the peace and
prosperity of the one who has left the paths of sin
and hard cider and whiskey, etc., and is walkin’ in
the paths of sobriety and success.</p>

<p>But to them not interested so much in this cause,
so dear to the heart of her whose name wuz once
Smith, the subject may grow monotunous and
tejus, so I will resoom and take up the thread of
my discourse over my finger agin, and let it purr
along on the spool of History.</p>

<p class="h2sub">A HEATHEN’S STANDARD OF MORALITY.</p>

<p>Wall, Al Faizi hearn this story about the contoggler’s
sufferin’s and the doin’s of the B. I. L., and I
never see him so riz up about anything as he wuz
with that.</p>

<p>Sez he&mdash;“This man who loved the child sold
stuff to his father that he knew would make him
liable to murder him? I cannot believe it possible
that such a crime can be permitted.</p>

<p>“To one coming from a heathen land it seems
incredible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “I’ve always said that it wuz a
worse practice than any savages ever dremp of.”</p>

<p>Said Al Faizi&mdash;</p>

<p>“This is probably the one solitary instance that
ever occurred where the death of a person much
beloved was caused by a man for a few cents’ gain.”</p>

<p>“One instance!” sez I; “why, all over this broad
country, day after day, and year after year, murders
are brought about almost solely by this cause!”</p>

<p>He sithed deep and seemed to be turnin’ in his
mind some possible remedy for this dretful state of
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Could not these men be persuaded to stop this
trade that kills men in this world, and destroys
their hopes of Heaven?”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “they can’t be persuaded; it has
been tried by good men and good wimmen for
years and years; they will keep on, driv by Selfishness
and Ignorance, that span of bloody
beasts!”</p>

<p>“Could not the law interfere?” sez he; “could
not your great police force step in and punish these
dreadful doings?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It could, if it wuzn’t spendin’ its hull
strength on devisin’ ways to protect the liquor
traffic.</p>

<p>“The police might bring some on ’em up if it
wuzn’t a-sneakin’ into side-doors a-partakin’ on the
sly of the poison!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It gits braced up in this way, so’s it’s
ready to drag off to jail the poor, weak drunkards,
made so by the saloons, and by the men who supply
the saloons, and by the voters who make this
thing possible, and by the goverment that sustains
it.”</p>

<p>“Why does not your great nation interfere and
compel them to stop it?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Because this great nation is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> company with
’em,” sez I&mdash;“partakers in this iniquity, and
takin’ part of the bloody gain.”</p>

<p>And my feathers drooped and my face wuz as red
as blood to have to own up these things to a
heathen, that wuz a-contrastin’ our ways with his
own, which wuz so much more superior and riz up
on the liquor question.</p>

<p>“Your holy church,” sez he, “why does not
that, so great and powerful a force in this land,
why does it not interfere and frown down these
wicked ways? Why does it not pronounce its
anathema on all those who commit this sin&mdash;this
B.I.L., as I have heard him called, and men like
him, who own saloons and supply the stuff that
makes murderers?”</p>

<p>“This B.I.L.,” sez I, “is a piller in his meetin’-house.
He sets in the highest place,” sez I.</p>

<p>“One of your holy men who take charge of the
sacred things, permitted by your customs to carry
on such iniquity? I cannot understand it,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“Nobody ort to understand it!” Sez I,
“It is a shame and a disgrace, anyway!”</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “in my own country our men
who take part in holy observances have to lead
pure lives&mdash;to fast and pray continually. I cannot
understand that one would be permitted to carry on
an evil business six days during the week and
touch the sacred things of your religion the seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
day.”</p>

<p>Agin I sez&mdash;“Nobody ort to understand it; it
would be a shame to heathen countries!” sez I.</p>

<p>Sez he&mdash;“This very man who was the cause of all
this wretchedness and crime and murder&mdash;he prays
for the heathen, does he not?”</p>

<p>“I spoze so,” sez I.</p>

<p>“He carries round the vessel in which you gather
the money to send to the heathen for charity and
instruction?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I; “but we call it the contribution
plate.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sez he, “we refuse to accept his money;
we refuse to take the money that man desecrates by
touching.</p>

<p>“And,” sez he, “I will tell him so.”</p>

<p>And so I spoze he did&mdash;good, simple-minded
creeter. He didn’t seem to have but two idees in
his head&mdash;one to learn the will of God, and the
other to do it.</p>

<p>And from what I’ve hearn sence I guess he did
impress the B.I.L.</p>

<p>The idee of havin’ a heathen from heathen lands
come to labor with him on religion kinder shook
him up, from all I can hear.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t wonder if he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> leave off his dretful
trade, and come part way up to a heathen’s standard
of morality.</p>

<p>But if he duz, no thanks are due to our own law
or to our own gospel. They wuz both weighed in
the balances and found wantin’.</p>

<p>If things are ever put on a more religious and noble
and riz up footin’ it will all be caused by the
missionary efforts of a heathen.</p>

<p>But to resoom.</p>

<p>Another thing about our contoggler interested
Al Faizi dretfully. It wuz some talks he had with
her about wimmen’s dress.</p>

<p>Annie wuz sensible, and hated the tight girtin’s
indulged in by some of our females. And Al Faizi
expressed the greatest wonder at the ignorance and
folly showed by civilized wimmen.</p>

<p>The pressin’ in and destroyin’ all the vital organs
by lacin’ in the waist. He expressed great
wonder that a civilized people could commit this
crime aginst the laws of health and the solemn
laws of heredity.</p>

<p>He said when he contrasted the loose, comfortable
robes of his own wimmen with the deformities
caused by tight lacin’, more and more he wondered
at the strange sights of civilization.</p>

<p>And then he said that in hospitals (for this strange
creeter had peered round everywhere in search of
knowledge), he had seen some of the terrible effects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of tight lacin’ and high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p>He said that he had seen cases of blindness,
caused by the last, and a destruction of the
nerves.</p>

<p>In lacin’, he had seen dretful cases of internal
diseases, incurable, and had seen terrible diseases in
infants, caused alone by this destructive custom of
the mothers&mdash;young infants who, if they lived, must
carry a maimed body through life with ’em, caused
alone by this habit.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Compare these high-heeled shoes with
the loose, comfortable sandals that our own women
wear. And these painful steel waists, that compress
the lungs and heart, with our own women’s loose,
flowing garments,” and he wuz astounded at our
ways.</p>

<p>Wall, I agreed with him from the bottom of my
heart, but sech is poor human nater that it kinder
galded me to have my sect so sot down on and despised
by a heathen. And I, kinder onbeknown to
me, brung up their own veiled wimmen. “And,”
sez I, “every country has its own shortcomin’s; I
don’t like the idee of your wimmen havin’ their
faces all covered up with veils.”</p>

<p>My tone wuz kinder het up and agitated.</p>

<p>But his voice wuz as sweet and calm as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>the evenin’
breeze a-blowin’ over a bed of Japanese lilies.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “perhaps we err in that direction,
in veiling our women too much from the public
gaze.</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “I went to a grand party once in
your great city Chicago, and to one also in Washington,
and I see the women’s forms almost entirely
disrobed and nude, while great folds of cloth trailed
after them down on the floor. I knew not where to
look for shame, for even when I was a nursing babe
in my mother’s arms, I could not have witnessed
such sights.</p>

<p>“And while we Eastern people may err in the
direction of veiling the charms of our women-kind,
methinks you Western people err still further in the
opposite direction. At these public parties I saw
the naked forms of the women, displayed with far
more than the freedom of the courtesans in my own
country, and my heart sank down with shrinking
and wonder at the strange customs of civilization.”</p>

<p>I felt meachin’. I felt small enough to have
gone to bed through my bedroom key-hole. But I
thought I wouldn’t. I only sez&mdash;“Wall, I guess it
is about bed-time.”</p>

<p>Josiah had already sought repose in our bedroom.</p>

<p>And Al Faizi got up at once and took his night-lamp,
and bid me good-night with one of his low,
reverential bows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<div class="figleft illowp50" id="i_112" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>WITH ONE OF HIS LOW, REVERENTIAL
BOWS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I knew what he said wuz the truth. I had meditated
on it. And in my own way I had tried to
break it up&mdash;the tight-lacin’, train-dragglin’, high-heeled
doin’s.</p>

<p>But, as I say, it galded me deeply to
hear these truths discanted on by a heathen.</p>

<p>I love my sect, and wish her dretful
well, and I can’t bear to see heathens
a-lookin’ down on her.</p>

<p>And then Al Faizi hearn about how
little children are put to work at a tender
age down in the damp, dark mines, shet
away from Heaven’s light, through long,
long days, until their youth is gone and
old age dims their eyes.</p>

<p>And he sot off for a distant part of the
country to see the owners of the mines, and see for
himself, and use his influence to have this evil abolished.</p>

<p>And then he hearn about how young children are
bought in the great stores of the big citys.</p>

<p>He hearn all the tales of sin and woe connected
with sech doin’s&mdash;worse than the Masacreein’ of the
Innocents.</p>

<p>He sot out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> to once to investigate, and to warn,
and to rebuke.</p>

<p>And he hearn with wonder and unbelief, at first,
the story how children could sell their honor and
all their hopes of the futer at a tender age.</p>

<p>And how this great nation permits this iniquity,
and makes laws to perpetuate it, and shield the
guilty men who indulge in this sin.</p>

<p>And all the horrows that gathers round them infamous
words&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Age of Consent.”</p>

<p>As he talked with me about it, I could see by the
deep fire that wuz lit up in his usually soft eyes his
burnin’ indignation aginst this idee that had jest
been promulgated to him.</p>

<p>Sez he&mdash;“You Christians talk a sight about the
car of Juggernaut that rolls on over living victims
and crushes them down, but,” sez he, “death leaves
the soul free to fly home to its paradise; but your
Christian country has found the way to ruin the
<i>souls</i> of children, as well as their bodies. How can
you sit down calmly and know that such a law is in
existence? How can mothers happily watch their
sweet little baby girls at play, and know that such a
horrible danger lurks in the path their ignorant
little feet have got to tread, such a snare is set for
them?”</p>

<p>“They <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>don’t set calm and happy&mdash;mothers
don’t!” I bust out; “their hearts and souls are full.
They cry to God in their anguish and fear, but they
can’t do nothin’ else, wimmen can’t; men made
this law, made it for men. Men say they don’t
want to put wimmen to the trouble of votin’, and
so they hender ’em from the hardship of droppin’ a
little scrap of paper in a small box once a year, and
give ’em this corrodin’, constant fear and anguish to
carry with ’em day and night, like a load of swords
and simeters, every one of ’em a-stabbin’ their
hearts.”</p>

<p>“But how can men, fathers of young girls, make
this law, or allow it to go on? Don’t they think
of their own young daughters, who may be ruined
by it?”</p>

<p>“They don’t make this law and vote for this law
for their own girls&mdash;it is to ruin other men’s girls
that it is made.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they know that the sword of retribution
is two-sided&mdash;that it is liable to cut down their own
beloved?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t think at all; their vile passions
clog up their ears and blind their eyes.”</p>

<p>“But your ministers, your holy men, what are
they doing? I supposed their mission was to preach
to sinners, and try to make the world better. I
have heard them speak of many things in the high
places where they stand to warn the people of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
sins, and the judgment to come, but I never heard
them allude to this. Why do they let this enormous
crime go on unrebuked?”</p>

<p>“The land knows!” sez I; “I don’t; they go on
year in and year out, a-preachin’ about Job’s sufferin’s,
and Pharo’s hardness of heart, and the Deluge,
and other ancient sins and sufferin’s all healed up
and done away with centuries ago.</p>

<p>“Why, it is six thousand years sence Pharo’s
heart hardened or Job’s biles ached, and the green
grass of centuries has riz up over the sweepin’
swash of the Deluge, but they will calmly go on
Sunday after Sunday for years a-preachin’ on that
agony and that wickedness and that overflow, and
not one word do they say about the hardness of
heart of the men who make and permit this law,
which makes Pharo’s hardness seem like putty in
comparison, or the agony and dread this law brings
to mothers’ hearts in the night watches, a-thinkin’
on’t, and thinkin’ of their own helplessness to protect
the ones who they would give their life for.
And the depths of wretchedness that overwhelms
the souls this law wuz made to ruin! What are
biles compared to these pains?</p>

<p>“But the clergymen, the most on ’em, go calmly
on a-pintin’ these old sins and pains out, and the
overflow of the Deluge, and drawin’ tenthlies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>and
twentiethlies from ’em, and not one word about this
cryin’ iniquity, so great that it seems as if it would
open the very sluce-ways of Heaven and let a new
flood down onto this guilty age that will allow sech
crime to go on unrebuked.</p>

<p>“And philosophers will moralize on old laws and
new ones, and their cause and effects; on Heaven
and earth, and not seemin’ly cast a eye of their
spectacles on this law of sin and shame that rises
up right before their eyes. And scientists rack
their brains to discover new laws and utilize old
ones, but don’t make a effort towards discoverin’ a
way to avert this enormous cause of woe and guilt,
this fur-reachin’ and ever-increasin’ anguish and
crime. And law-makers, instead of tryin’ to overcome
it, try their best to perpetuate it and make it
permanent; bend all their powers of intellect, band
together, and use the cunnin’ of serpents and the
wisdom of old Lucifer to git their laws passed and
git Uncle Sam to jine in with ’em. Poor misguided
old creeter, a-bein’ led off by his old nose,
and made to consent to this crime and help it
along!”</p>

<p>Al Faizi had been listenin’ in deep thought, and
now he sez: “This uncle of yours I know him
not; but your great Government, could it not interfere
and stop this iniquity?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“It could” (sez I, mad as a hen)&mdash;“it could, if it
wuzn’t jined right in with them law-makers and
helpin’ ’em along; and,” sez I, “now they’re tryin’
to git the poor old creeter to consent to a new
idee. Some big clergymen and other wise men are
a-tryin’ to have these wimmen, ruined by the evil
passions of men, shet up in a certain pen to keep
’em from doin’ harm to innocent folks, and not one
word said about shettin’ up the men who have
made these wimmen what they are. Why don’t
they shet them up? There they be foot loose.
If they have ruined one pen full of wimmen, what
henders ’em from spilin’ another pen full? But
there they be a-runnin’ loose and even a-votin’ on
how firm and strong the pen should be made to
confine these victims of theirn. And how big
salaries the men who keep these pens in order shall
have&mdash;good big salaries, I’ll warrant you. Wise
men and ministers advocate this onjestice, and laymen
are glad to practise what they preach.</p>

<p>“There hain’t nothin’ reasonable in it; if a pen
has got to be made for bad wimmen, why not have
another pen, jest like it, only a great deal bigger,
made for the bad man?</p>

<p>“Why, this seems so reasonable and right I
should think that Jestice would lift the bandage
offen her eyes and holler out and say it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> he
done! But no, there hain’t no move made towards
pennin’ bad men up&mdash;not a move.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi sez&mdash;“I cannot understand these
strange things.”</p>

<p>And I sez&mdash;“Nobody can, unless it is old Belzibub;
I guess he gits the run on it.”</p>

<p>Wall, he took out that book of hisen and writ
for pretty nigh an hour.</p>

<p>And that is jest the way he went on and acted
from day to day.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">A LITTLE FUN AND ITS PRICE.</p>

<p>Al Faizi got acquainted with the Baptist minister
at Jonesville, and Elder Dean took to that
noble heathen in a remarkable way. He wuz a
truly Christian man and deep learnt, and he and Al
Faizi talked together right in my presence in languages,
a good many of them dead, I spoze, and
some on ’em, jedgin’ from the sound, in a sickly
and dyin’ state.</p>

<p>Elder Dean wuz English, college bred. Been
abroad as a missionary, broke down, and come to
Jonesville with a weak voice and lungs, but a full
head and a noble heart, for six hundred dollars a
year and parsonage found.</p>

<p>They’d always had a hard time, bein’ put to it for
things and kinder sickly. But he and his heroic
wife had one flower in their life that wuz a-bustin’
into full bloom, and a-sweetenin’ their hard present
and their wearisome past, and the promise and
beauty on’t a-throwin’ a bright, clear light clear
acrost their futer&mdash;even down the steep banks
where the swift stream rushes through the dark,
and clear over onto the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>This brightness and blessin’ that lightened up
their hard and toilsome way wuz their only child,
a youth of such manly beauty and gentle goodness
that his love made up to ’em, so they said to me,
for all they had suffered and all they had lost
through their lives.</p>

<p>He had been brought up on clear love mostly.
His Pa and Ma had literally carried him in their
hearts from the time his sweet, baby face had smiled
up to ’em from his cradle.</p>

<p>Nobody could tell the tenderness and love that
had been lavished on him. His Ma jest lived in
him and his Pa, too, but their devotion hadn’t spilte
him, not at all&mdash;not mentally nor morally.</p>

<p>Though there wuz them that did think that his
Ma, bein’ so dretful tender of him and lookin’ out
so for his health in every way, had kinder weakened
his constitution and he would have been stronger if
he had roughed it more.</p>

<p>Bein’ watched over so lovin’ly all his days, he wuz
jest about as delicate and couldn’t stand any more
hardship than a girl; but he wuz stiddy and industrious,
a good Christian, and dretful ambitious. And
they looked forrered to him as bein’ an honor as
well as a blessin’ to ’em in the futer.</p>

<p>The minister had learnt him all he knew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> so he
said, and for years back they’d been savin’ every
penny they could, deprivin’ themselves of even
necessaries to git the money to send Harry to
college. From his babyhood they’d worked for
this. And jest before Al Faizi come to Jonesville,
the long looked-for and worked-for end had come&mdash;Harry
had gone to college, a-carryin’ with him
all his parents’ love and hope for the futer, and a
small trunk full of necessaries, some Balsam of Fir
for his lungs, and some plasters and things his Ma
had put in.</p>

<p>Wall, as I said, Elder Dean had took dretfully to
Al Faizi, and he to him. So one day I invited the
elder and his wife over to dinner. I went myself
to gin ’em the invitation.</p>

<p>I found the elder a carefully coverin’ a old book
of poems he had bought, which wuz very rare, so
he said, and jest what Harry had wanted. He had
took the money he had been savin’ for a winter
coat, so I hearn afterwards, to buy it.</p>

<p>And she wuz knittin’ a african to put over the
couch in his room. She had ravelled out a good
shawl of her own to git the red for it, so I hearn.</p>

<p>“But,” she sez, “when he comes into his room a
little chilly, it will be so nice to throw over his feet,
and he always liked that soft, crimson color. He
gits cold real easy,” sez she, a-holdin’ up the african
and lookin’ real affectionate at it. It wuz a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
african.</p>

<p>I asked ’em to come to dinner the next day, and
they both demurred at first, sayin’ that it wuz the
day for Harry’s long letter to come. He writ ’em
long letters twice a week, and they both felt that
they wanted to be right there by the post-office so’s
to git it the minute it arrove.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz compromised in this way&mdash;I promisin’
that Ury should be at the post-office when the
afternoon mail come in and bring it to ’em right to
our house. And I mentioned that the old mair
could go pretty fast when Ury and Necessity wuz
a-drivin’ her; so they consented to come.</p>

<p>And I cooked up dretful good vittles. I don’t
think they’re ever than above well fed to home, and
I did enjoy a-cookin’ up good, nourishin’ food for
’em with Philury’s help.</p>

<p>I had some good beef soup, two roast chickens,
with garden sass of all kinds, cream biscuit, strawberry
shortcake and jell, and rich, yellow coffee with
cream and loaf sugar in it.</p>

<p>I did well by ’em.</p>

<p>And I had a real good visit with ’em; for I jest
as lives spend my time a-hearin’ about Harry as
not. I wuz a-knittin’, and of course could hear and
knit. And Josiah and Al Faizi (good creeters both
on ’em) had jest as lives hear the elder praise up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
his boy in dead languages as in live ones.</p>

<p>And so they enjoyed themselves real well.</p>

<p>As I say, when the elder would git tired of
praisin’ him up in English he would try it in Greek,
and when that language got tired out and kinder
dead, he would try a healthier, stronger one, so I
spoze. He and Al Faizi sot out in the porch some
of the time, but I could hear ’em.</p>

<p>Miss Dean and I got along first-rate in our own
native tongues, though once in awhile I felt that,
visitor or no visitor, I had to sprunt up a little and
tell my mind about Thomas J., and what a remarkable
boy he always wuz, and what a man he’d made.</p>

<p>But I see they wuz so oneasy when they wuzn’t
a-praisin’ Harry that I switched off the track as
polite as I could and gin ’em a clear sweep. And
from that time Happiness and Harry rained supreme
in our settin’-room and piazza. And reminescenes
wuz brung up and plans laid on and
prophecies foretold, and all wuz Harry, Harry,
Harry.</p>

<p>Wall, I see Miss Dean kep’ a-lookin’ at the
clock, though I told her it lacked three hours of
train time. But in the same cause of politeness I
had held up through the day I sent Ury off a
hour before it wuz time, and in due time he come
back bearin’ a letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>He brung it up to the stoop and handed it to
the elder.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>As the Elder took it he turned pale.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As the elder took it he turned pale&mdash;white as a
piece of white cotton shirt, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“This is not Harry’s hand!”</p>

<p>Miss Dean jest leaped forward and ketched
holt of his hand.</p>

<p>“What is it? Not Harry’s writin’, what does
it mean?”</p>

<p>Wall, when the letter wuz opened, we found
what it meant.</p>

<p>Dead! dead! That bright young life, full of
hope and beauty and promise, had been cut down
like a worthless weed by the infamous practice of
Hazin’.</p>

<p>Gentlemen’s sons, young men who had had every
means of civilization at their command, had committed
the brutality of a savage. Young men of
riches, education, culture, position, they had committed
this murder jest for wanton fun. They had
called him out of his bed at midnight on a false
errent, locked him out of his room for hours,
poured a lot of icy water on him; he, shiverin’
with his almost naked limbs, had plead in vain for
help.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>
<p>Where wuz his Ma and Pa at this time? Asleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and dreamin’ of him, mebby.</p>

<p>A congestive chill had attackted the weak lungs,
and in two days he wuz dead.</p>

<p>One of the pupils not engaged in it, in deep sympathy
and pity, writ the hull thing out to the bereaved
parents.</p>

<p>We carried ’em home and helped ’em out of the
democrat&mdash;helped ’em to walk into the house, for
they couldn’t walk alone. We sot him down under
a picter of Harry that had fresh flowers under it&mdash;laid
her on a couch covered with the woosted
work she wuz a-makin’ for him, and took care on
’em as well as we could while they waited for Harry
to come home.</p>

<p>Oh dear me! Oh dear suz!!!</p>

<p>I can’t tell nothin’ about that time. My pen
trembles, jest as my heart duz, when I try to write
about it.</p>

<p>I’m a-goin’ to hang up a black bumbazeen curtain
between the reader and that seen for the next
few days. Reader, it is best for you that I do it&mdash;you
couldn’t stand it if I didn’t.</p>

<p>The curtain ort to be crape, but crape, though all
right in the line of mournin’, is pretty thin for
the purpose&mdash;you might see through it.</p>

<p>But I will jest lift up a corner on’t a few days
later to show you another coffin, with the broken-hearted
mother a-layin’ in it, with a broken-down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
old man bendin’ over it alone, waitin’ for the summons
to jine ’em in another country.</p>

<p>One victim buried, another victim layin’ in the
coffin, another victim, most to be pitied of all,
a-stayin’ on here alone in a dark world a-waitin’ for
the end.</p>

<p>Gay, light-hearted young man, havin’ a good
time at college&mdash;sowin’ your wild oats&mdash;havin’
royal good fun, what do you think of the end of
that night’s jollity?</p>

<p>Al Faizi couldn’t understand it. Sez he to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“His murderers will be hanged, will they not?”</p>

<p>“Hung!” sez I in astonishment; “oh, no! this is
merely Hazin’&mdash;college fun for young gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” sez he. “Do gentlemen murder in
your country? Why, your missionaries tell our
people that if they murder they must be hanged in
this world and eternally punished in the next.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, “these young gentlemen were simply
havin’ a little fun!” My tone wuz as bitter as
wormwood and gaul, and he see it.</p>

<p>“Has such a thing ever been done before in this
country?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” sez I (wormwood and gaul still saturating
my axents); “it is very common&mdash;it is always
practised. Sometimes the victims are only frightened
to death and maimed and made idiots and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
invalids of; sometimes they don’t die so soon; but
then, agin,” sez I, “they die fur quicker&mdash;sometimes,
when the young gentlemen want to be extra
funny, and use some deadly gas, their victim dies to
once, right under their hands.”</p>

<p>“But don’t the Government interfere to punish
such dreadful deeds?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” sez I; “the Government has its hands
too full a-grantin’ licenses and sech, sellin’ the stuff
that helps to make these disgraceful seens.”</p>

<p>“Well, do not men and women rise and punish
such deeds themselves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” sez I; “wimmen are considered too
feeble-minded to pass any jedgment on sech doin’s&mdash;they’re
considered by the college professors and
presidents, as a general thing, as too weak-minded
and volatile to take in a college education, and men
are kep’ pretty busy a-bringin’ up arguments to
keep wimmen in their place.</p>

<p>“Of course, no sech doin’s ever took place in a
woman’s college. They generally spend their time
in learnin’, and don’t riot round and act, and that itself
is considered, I believe, an evidence that wimmen
are inheriently weak and not really fitted for
the higher education. It is, I believe, considered a
damagin’ evidence agin her powers of mind to
think she don’t have no hankerin’ to spend her college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
days a-gittin’ up the reputation of a prizefighter
and a boat-swain, and had ruther spend her
time a-bringin’ out the strength of her mind and
soul instead of her muscles.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Take that with her refusal to kill and
maim and torture her fellow students by Hazin’,
and her dislike to cigarettes, drinkin’, etc.&mdash;take ’em
all together, though she carries off prizes right and
left for learnin’ and good behavior, yet these weaknesses
of hern in refusin’ to jine in such upliftin’
exercises, tells agin her dretfully in the eyes of the
male world!”</p>

<p>Oh! how the wormword showed in my axent as
I spoke.</p>

<p>“Of all the strange things which I have seen
in your strange country,” sez Al Faizi, “this is one
of the strangest&mdash;a civilized nation practising such
barbarities!”</p>

<p>And he took out that little book with the cross
on’t and writ for a quarter of an hour, and I d’no
but more.</p>

<p>Wall, the days went along, one after another, as
days will, droppin’ off, droppin’ off the rosary Time
counts its beads on, and the time pretty near
elapsted for us to embark on our trip to Europe.</p>

<p>The tickets wuz bought, the nightcaps wuz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
packed, and the time drawed near.</p>

<p>But as the time aproached, the thought of the
deepness of the water in the Atlantic growed more
and more apparient to me.</p>

<div class="figright illowp82" id="i_131" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>I took down my old Atlas.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I took down my old Atlas and Gography from
the cupboard over the suller way and poured over
’em, and sithed, and sithed and poured.</p>

<p>The distance looked fearful between shore and
shore, and my reason told me, also experience, that
the reality wuz jest as much worse as black water is
worse than yeller paper.</p>

<p>The ocean wuz painted on this old Atlas bright
yeller.</p>

<p>And the last time Al Faizi came back from quite
a long trip he had took to Washington and New
York he found me a-pourin’ over the old Atlas;
while the nightcaps and dressin’-gown, all done up,
lay on a stand by my side.</p>

<p>As I mentioned more formally, I’d made a nice
flannel dressin’-gown for myself, and it satisfied my
desires for comfort and also my pride; though I
didn’t act over it as my pardner did over hisen.
No; a sense of dignity and propriety restrained me.</p>

<p>I cut it out by my nightgown pattern and made
it fuller&mdash;it looked well. It wuz a brown and red
stripe, tied down in front with lute string ribbin,
that I paid as high as 14 cents a yard for, and
thought it none too good for the occasion; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
thought in case of a panick at sea, and I had to appear
in it, I wouldn’t begrech the outlay for the
ribbin.</p>

<p>And then, agin, seein’ we wuzn’t to any extra expense
for the voyage, I thought it wuzn’t extravagant
in us to lanch out in clothes, or that is, lanch
out some in ’em, not too fur.</p>

<p>For I didn’t believe in goin’ through Europe follered
by a dray full of trunks.</p>

<p>No; I felt that two large satchels, that we could
carry ourselves, wuz what the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>That wuz our first thought, though we afterwards
decided to take a trunk.</p>

<p>Of course I took my mantilly, with tabs. It wuz
jest as good as it ever wuz, and a big woollen
shawl to wear when it wuz cold on the
steamer. And my good, honorable bunnet,
with my usual green baize veil to
drape it gracefully on the left side.</p>

<p>My umbrell, it is needless
to say, occupied its usual place
in my outfit&mdash;protection from
storms and tramps and other
dangers, and it could also be
used for a cane.</p>

<p>Noble utensil! I would have felt lost indeed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
have missed it from its accustomed place at my
right hand.</p>

<p>As I say, Al Faizi come back and found us engrossed
in preperations and study.</p>

<p>I with my Atlas, and Josiah carefully brushin’
his dressin’-gown, though there wuzn’t a speck
of dust on it, and a-smoothin’ out them tossels.</p>

<p>We wuz a-makin’ our last preperations, for it
only lacked about six weeks of the time when we
wuz to embark. Our satchels stood all unlocked,
with the keys fastened to ’em with good strong weltin’
cord, so’s we wouldn’t have to hunt for the keys
at the last minute. Some long letters for the relations
on both sides lay on Josiah’s desk, to be sent
after our departure; they wuz dretful affectin’ letters;
we thought more’n as like as not they would bring
tears.</p>

<p>And as Al Faizi come in and witnessed our hasty
preperations, he announced in that calm way of hisen
that he would go with us.</p>

<p>For a minute I wuz dumfoundered, and knew not
whether I wuz tickled to death at the proposal, or
felt sorry and meachin’ over it.</p>

<p>I felt queer.</p>

<p>Sez Al Faizi, “I come to your land expecting I
hardly know what.</p>

<p>“My heart had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> touched by learning of
your holy religion. I had accepted the teachings
of the blessed Lord Christ with all my heart and
soul; warmed by His love, I come to your country
to learn what that Divine religion would be
amongst the people who had followed His teachings
eighteen hundred years, and had no false religion
to paralyze its power&mdash;&mdash;and now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, for Al Faizi paused for a good
while, not a-lookin’ mad, nor pert, nor anythin’,
but jest earnest and some sad, and very
quiet.</p>

<p>“Now what?” sez I.</p>

<p>He didn’t say nothin’. He looked as if he wuz
afraid of hurtin’ somebody’s feelin’s; but at last he
said in that soft, melodious voice of hisen&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, I should like to go to other lands.”</p>

<p>I felt fearful meachin’, and showed it, I spoze, to
have a Hindoo come here and git disgusted with
our ways, for I mistrusted that he wuz, though he
didn’t say so out plain. And there wuzn’t a shadder
of blame on his face; jest calm and earnest,
jest as he always had been, and always would be,
so fur as I could tell.</p>

<p>He couldn’t find Truth and Jestice here, and so
he wuz for follerin’ off on their trail over the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>I felt queer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span> as a dog, but Josiah hailed the idee
with joy. He seemed highly tickled to have one
more ingregient of curosity added to our cavalcade.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE EMBARKATION.</p>

<p>And so it wuz settled, and Martin bein’ writ to
to git another ticket, he got it, and sent it in a
letter to us. But what he would say when he see
the passenger who wuz goin’ to use it I knew
not, but I knew that Alice and Adrian wuz good-natered,
and would feel as I did about usin’ folks
well. And then I remembered that complaint in
Martin’s eyes, and felt that if he didn’t take to
Al Faizi, he would most probble be so near-sighted
that he couldn’t see him much, if any.</p>

<p>And so it turned out (to go ahead of the wagon
a spell, or, ruther, to paddle backwards a few furlongs),
after the first conversation Martin held with
him, and see what his bizness wuz over here in
America and wuz a-goin’ to be in Europe&mdash;Martin’s
eyes wuz so bad that he couldn’t see him
hardly ever.</p>

<p>But Alice wuz sweet and courteous to him, and
Adrian liked him dretfully from the first. And Al
Faizi, when he first see Alice’s sweet face, he
stood stun still for more’n quite a spell.</p>

<p>And on his dark, handsome face dawned a look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
sech as a man might have who had been walkin’
a considerable time through a underground way,
who had come out full in view of the mornin’ sun
a-risin’ up on a June world.</p>

<p>I d’no as anybody noticed that look but jest
me; I don’t believe they did, for Martin wuz talkin’
to Josiah in a dretful kind and patronizin’ way,
and Alice wuz all took up a-lookin’ with her
heart’s eye on the land where her prince reigned.</p>

<p>And Adrian wuz, as I say, dretful took up with
Al Faizi, and see nothin’ in his dark, expressive
face only what he looked for, and what he found
in it from day to day all through our tower&mdash;the
good nater of a patient comrade, who loved him
for his own bright, winnin’ little self, and loved
him more for the sake of another, whose heart’s
joy Adrian wuz.</p>

<p>Martin’s eye complaint seemed to be real bad
so fur as the noble heathen wuz concerned.</p>

<p>I guess Al Faizi, in the first conversation he had
with him, tackled him in the everlastin’ cause of
jestice, and pity, and mercy&mdash;subjects that Martin
hain’t “<i>o fay</i>” in (that is French. I seldom use
foreign languages, but I’ve hearn Maggie use it
considerable, and know it is lawful).</p>

<p>No; Martin and Al Faizi looked on this earth
and the things of life with sech different pairs of
eyes that I d’no as they could be said to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> on
this old planet on the same side.</p>

<p>Al Faizi looked on the deep side of subjects.
He looked fur down under the outside current to
try to discern the hidden springs, from whence
these clear and turbid torrents flowed.</p>

<p>If he found a spring that yielded black water,
his first thought wuz to give warnin’ and try to
dam it up.</p>

<p>Martin would try to keep it a-humpin’, so’s to
utilize it&mdash;sell the mud that flowed from it, mebby.</p>

<p>Al Faizi’s gaze pierced through the clouds of
earth, and rested on the gold pinnacles of Heaven.</p>

<p>Martin clutched handfuls of the gold ore of earth
and held it clost to his eyes, and so shet out the
sight of the Heavenly City.</p>

<p>One wuz honestly a-tryin’ to sweep away utterly
the vile sperits of ignorance, evil, and want, etc., etc.
Martin wuz for catchin’ ’em and hitchin’ ’em to his
lawn-mower, to keep the lawn smooth round the
house of his earthly tabernacle.</p>

<p>Curous extremes as ever met, I believe, and as
interestin’ to witness from day to day as the most
costly and curous menagerie of wild animals would
be.</p>

<p>But, as I said, Martin’s eyes bein’ formed in jest
that way, he wuzn’t able to hardly see the noble
heathen after that first interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Wall, to go back to the wagon agin and proceed
onwards with my history, or paddle back to the
steamer.</p>

<p>At last the last minute come&mdash;Ury and Philury
had took us to the cars and been shooken by the
hands, and amidst fervent good-byes had been
adjured over and over about the necessity of keepin’
the cat out of the milk room, and the gate shet between
the garden and paster, etc., etc., etc., etc.,
etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>And they had promised faithfully to adhere to
our wishes, and to advise us of the results in weekly
letters.</p>

<p>We let ’em move right in and have half of everything&mdash;butter,
cheese, eggs, wool, black caps, etc.
And they wuz highly tickled as well as we.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson and Maggie had gone with us
to the station, where Whitfield and Tirzah Ann put
in a late appearance, on account of Tirzah’s bein’
ondecided whether to wear a thick or a thin dress;
the day bein’ one of them curous ones when you
don’t really know whether it will be hazy or warm.</p>

<p>And they’d come in time to kiss us and clasp our
hands in partin’.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_139" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_139.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>In time to kiss us and clasp our hands in partin’.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The girls both brought bokays with ’em, and
Babe, the darlin’, brought a bunch of English
violets to send to Adrian, knowin’ that he jest worshipped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>that posy&mdash;and it’s one of my favorites, too.
Wall, the last words wuz said to us, Al Faizi had
made his last low bow to the children, and said the
last polite, melodious adieu, and we embarked on to
the cars.</p>

<p>But I looked back, and I see Tirzah Ann
a-wrestlin’ with her polynay, that had got ketched
into her parasol, and Whitfield a-helpin’ her to ondo
herself.</p>

<p>And I see Maggie’s sweet, upward look to the
car winder, and met the clear, affectionate, comprehendin’
look of my boy, Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>It is curous how well acquainted our sperits be
with each other, hisen and mine, and always has
been, from the time when he sot on my lap as a
child. Our souls are clost friends, and would be if
he wuzn’t no kin to me.</p>

<p>He is a young man of a thousand, and he understands
my mind without my speakin’, and I do
hisen.</p>

<p>But to resoom. It had been arranged that we
should proceed directly to a hotel that wuz nigh to
the Atlantic, and Martin should call for us there,
his own residence bein’ in a opposite direction.</p>

<p>We did so, and after a good meal&mdash;and we all did
jestice to it, bein’ hungry&mdash;a big carriage driv up,
and Martin alighted from it and come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Anon we embarked in it, and after a seen of
almost indescribable tumult, owin’ to the screamin’
of drivers, the conflict of passin’ wagons and carriages
and dray carts, etc., etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>And after numerous givin’s up on my part that
now indeed wuz the time I wuz to “likewise perish,”
we found ourselves on the big steamer’s deck that
wuz to bear us away from our own native land.</p>

<p>Lots of folks wuz there a-takin’ leave of friends.
Some wuz weepin’, some wuz laughin’, some wuz
talkin’, and that las’ some wuz multiplied by hundreds
and thousands, seemin’ly.</p>

<p>And piles of flowers lay round, offerin’s to and
from fond hearts that must sever.</p>

<p>Adrian had his bunch of sweet blue violets, and
the violets wuzn’t any sweeter than his eyes. And
I, even at the resk of losin’ my umbrell, clutched my
precious bokays&mdash;the frail links that seemed to connect
me with my own native Jonesville and my
loved ones there.</p>

<p>Josiah seemed to be lookin’ round for somebody
he could scrape acquaintance with.</p>

<p>And Al Faizi stood in that silent way of hisen,
with his dark, ardent face seemin’ly on the lookout
for sunthin’ or other he could learn, and a-seein’
every move that Alice made, as I could see, though
nobody else noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Martin wuz a-flyin’ round, busy a-seein’ to everything.
Alice wuz a little apart a-bendin’ over the
side of the great ship. She seemed to be lookin’
intently on sunthin’ or somebody on the pier, and
as we sailed off I see her
snowy handkerchief wave
out, and where she’d been
a-lookin’ I see an arm lifted
up and another white handkerchief
wave out a farewell.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Her big blue eyes wuz full of tears.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When I looked clost at
her, I see that her big blue
eyes wuz full of tears.</p>

<p>As for me, I wuz tryin’ my
best to keep my equilibrum,
for the boat tosted some, and
my equilibrum hain’t what it
would be if it hadn’t had the
rheumatiz so much.</p>

<p>But my umbrell helped me some; I planted it
down and leaned heavy on it, and in its faithful
companionship and support I found some relief as
I see the land sail swift away from me, seemin’ to
be in a hurry to go somewhere.</p>

<p>And I sez in my heart&mdash;“Good-bye, dear old
Land! you no need to be in sech a hurry to go
back and dissapear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> in the distance; no truer lover
did you ever have than she who now witnesses your
swift departure,” and even in my reverie wantin’ to
be exact, I added&mdash;“she whose name wuz once
Smith.”</p>

<p>Quite a while did I stand there until Reason and
also Josiah told me that I had better seek my state-room.</p>

<p>I don’t find no fault with that room, it probble
wuzn’t its fault that the narrer walls riz up so many
times, and seemed to hit me in my head and
stomach, specially the stomach, and then anon turn
round with me, and teeter, and bow down, and
hump up, and act.</p>

<p>No; the little room wuzn’t to blame, and my sufferin’s
with Josiah Allen for the three days when he
lay, as he said, in a dyin’ state, right over my
head&mdash;</p>

<p>I a-sufferin’ twice over&mdash;once in myself and agin
in my other and more fraxious and worrisome self.</p>

<p>The wild demeanors, the groans, the frenzied exclamations,
and anon the faint and die-away actions
of that man can’t never be described upon, and if
it could, it would make readin’ that no man would
want to read, nor no woman neither.</p>

<p>But after a long interval, in which, while I wuz
a-layin’, a-tryin’ in a agonized way to think how I
wanted my effects distributed amongst the survivors&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
would be called away from that contemplation
to receive my pardner’s last wills and testaments,
and I heard anon or oftener, spoke in solemn
axents&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bury me in the dressin’-gown, Samantha.”</p>

<p>He clung to that idee, even in his lowest and
most sinkin’est moments.</p>

<p>I reached up, or tried to, and took holt of his limp
hand that dangled down over my head, and I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“You will live, Josiah, to wear it out.”</p>

<p>And as feeble as he wuz, and as much as he had
wanted to die, them words would seem to sooth him
some, and be a paneky to him.</p>

<p>I repeated ’em often, for they seemed to impress
him where more affectionate and moral arguments
failed.</p>

<p>But I may as well hang up a double rep curtain
between my hearers and the fearful seens that wuz
enacted in our state-rooms for nearly three days and
nights.</p>

<p>I hang a rep curtain, so’s it would shelter the seens
more; cretonne is too thin.</p>

<p>But some of the seens are so agonizin’ and sharp
pinted that they seem to pierce even through that
envelopin’ drapery.</p>

<p>One of them dagger-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> episodes wuz of the fog
horns.</p>

<p>If Josiah’s testementary idees and our united
wretchedness would have let me doze off some in
rare intervals, the tootin’ of them horns would be
sure to roust me up.</p>

<p>Yes, they made the night dretful&mdash;ringin’ of bells,
tootin’ of horns, etc.</p>

<p>And once, it wuz along in the latter part of the
night, I guess, I heard a loud cry a-risin’ above the
fog horn. It seemed to be a female in distress.</p>

<p>And Josiah wuz all rousted up in a minute.</p>

<p>And sez he&mdash;“Some female is in distress, Samantha!
Where is my dressin’-gown?” Sez he, “I will
go to her rescue!” And he rung the bell wildly for
the stewardess, and acted.</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“Josiah Allen, come back to bed! no
woman ever yelled so loud as that and lived! If it is
a female she’s beyend your help now.” And I curdled
down in bed agin, though I felt queer and felt
dretful sorry for her; but felt that indeed that yell
must have been her last, and that she wuz now at
rest.</p>

<p>But he wuz still wildly arrangin’ his gown, and
hollerin’ for the tossels&mdash;they’d slipped off from it.</p>

<p>“Where is them dum tossels?” he yelled; “must
I hear a female yell like that and not fly to her rescue?
Where is the tossels?” he yelled agin. “You
don’t seem to have no heart, Samantha, or you’d be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
rousted up!”</p>

<p>“I am rousted up!” sez I; “yes, indeed, I have
been rousted up ever sence I laid my head onto my
piller; but if you wuz so anxious to help and save,
Josiah, you wouldn’t wait for tossels!”</p>

<p>But at that minute, simultaneous and to once, the
chambermaid come to the door, and he found his
tossels.</p>

<p>“Who is that female a-screamin’?” sez Josiah,
a-tyin’ the cord in a big bow-knot.</p>

<p>“That is the Syren,” sez she. And she slammed
the door and went back; she wuz mad to be waked
up for that.</p>

<p>“The Syren!” sez Josiah; “what did I tell you,
Samantha?” And sez he, a-smoothin’ out the tossels,
“I wouldn’t have missed the sight for a dollar bill!
How lucky I found my tossels!” sez he.</p>

<p>“Yes, dretful lucky,” sez I faintly, for I wuz wore
completely out by my long night watches, and I felt
fraxious.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “I wouldn’t have appeared before
a Syren without them red tossels for no money. I
always wanted to see a Syren!” sez he, a-smoothin’
out the few hairs on each side of his cranium.</p>

<p>Sez he, “She wuz probble a-screamin’ for her
lookin’-glass and comb; I’ll go to once on deck. It
is a bad night; if she has missed her comb, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>I might
lend her my pocket-comb,” sez he.</p>

<p>“You let Syrens alone, Josiah Allen!” sez I, gittin’
rousted up; “you don’t want to meddle with
’em at all! and do you come back to bed.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” sez he; “here is the
chance of my lifetime. I’ve always
wanted to see a Syren, and now I’m
a-goin’ to!”</p>

<p>And he reached up to a peg and took
down his tall plug hat, and put it on
kinder to the side of his head in as
rakish a lookin’ way as you ever see a
deacon’s hat in the world; he then took
his umbrell and started for the door.</p>

<div class="figright illowp46" id="i_147" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_147.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Then took his umbrell and started for the door.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Agin come that loud and fearful
yell; it did, indeed, seem to be a female
in direst agony.</p>

<p>“But,” I sez, “I don’t believe that’s any Syren,
Josiah Allen; we read that her voice lures sailors to
foller her; no sailor would be lured by that voice,
it is enough to scare anybody and drive ’em back,
instead of forrered.</p>

<p>“What occasion would a Syren have to yell in
sech a blood-curdlin’ way, Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, put to his wits’ end, “mebby her
hair is all snarled up by the wind and salt water,
and in yankin’ out the snarls, it hurts her so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> she
yells.”</p>

<p>I see the common sense of this, for the first night
I had used soap and salt water my hair stood out
like quills on my head, and it almost killed me to
comb it out. “But,” sez I, “Syrens are used to wind
storms and salt water. I don’t spoze their hair is
like other folkses.”</p>

<p>Agin come that fearful, agonizin’ yell.</p>

<p>Agin Josiah sez&mdash;“While we are a-bandyin’ words
back and forth, I am losin’ the sight,” and agin he
made for the door.</p>

<p>But I follered him and ketched holt of the tossels.</p>

<p>He paused to once. He feared they would be injured.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Come back to bed; how it would look
in the Jonesville paper to hear that Josiah Allen
had been lured overboard by a Syren, for they
always try to drown men, Josiah!” sez I.</p>

<p>“Oh, shaw!” sez he; “they never had me to deal
with. I should stand still and argy with her&mdash;I always
convince the more opposite sect,” sez he, lookin’
vain.</p>

<p>But I see the allusion to drowndin’ made him
hesitate, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“You don’t spoze there is any danger of that, do
you, Samantha? I would give a dollar bill to tell
old Gowdey and Uncle Sime Bentley that I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
interviewed a Syren!” sez he. “It would make me
a lion, Samantha, and you a lioness.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be made any animal whatsoever, Josiah
Allen, by follerin’ up a Syren at this time of night.
They never did anything but harm, from their
grandmothers’ days down, and men have always
been fooled and drownded by ’em!” sez I; “you
let Syrens alone and come to bed,” sez I; “you’re a
perfessor and a grandfather, Josiah Allen, and I’d
try to act becomin’ to both on em,” sez I.</p>

<p>He fingered the red tossels lovin’ly.</p>

<p>“Sech a chance,” sez he, “mebby I never shall
have agin. I don’t spoze any man who ever parlied
with ’em wuz ever so dressy in his appearance, and
so stylish&mdash;no knowin’ what would come of it!”
sez he. He hated to give up the idee.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “it’s rainin’ as hard as it can; them
tossels never would come out flossy and beautiful
agin, they would all be limped and squashed down
and spilte.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” sez he anxiously.</p>

<p>He took off his hat and put down his umbrell,
and sez he&mdash;“It may be as well to not foller the
investigation to-night; there will probble be a
chance in fairer weather.”</p>

<p>But the next day we found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>out that the Syren
wuz a thing they fixed onto the fog horn for certain
signals, and Josiah felt glad enough that he hadn’t
made no moves to talk with her.</p>

<p>I wuz glad on the side of common sense. He on
the account of them tossels.</p>

<p>But after we found out what it wuz, and all
about it, that fog horn made us feel dretful lonesome
and queer when we heard it, half asleep and
half awake. It would seem as if one half of our
life wuz a-hollerin’ out to the other half.</p>

<p>Youth and middle age a-callin’ out to each
other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Loss! loss!” and “Gain! gain!” as the case
might be.</p>

<p>Jonesville and London, “Yell! yell!”</p>

<p>Love! peace! death! danger! “Shriek! shriek!”</p>

<p>Them you love who wuz here on earth, and
them who’d gone over the Great Flood, “Shout!
shout!”</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! What hail!”</p>

<p>Queer sounds as I ever hearn floated in on them
high yells, borne by the winds and the washin’
waves of ocean depths and the misty billows from
Sleep Land, broken up some as they drifted and
mixed with the billows of our own realm.</p>

<p>But daylight would always seem to calm down
this tumult and bring more lusid and practical
idees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>
<p>Wall, the time come when we tottered up on
deck, two pale, thin figgers, to be confronted by
other faces that wuz as wan, and some that wuz
wanner.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>We tottered up on deck, two pale, thin figgers.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But after these days we begun to feel first-rate.
Alice and Adrian had had a hard time of it, so I
had learned before from the stewardess. And I’d
sent ’em lovin’ messages time and agin, and they
me.</p>

<p>Martin, I don’t believe, had a minute’s sickness,
nor Al Faizi. They both seemed to be real chipper;
though they both seemed to be perfect strangers to
each other; and I spoze they wuz and will be to all
eternity&mdash;even if they wuz settin’ on the same seat
on high.</p>

<p>Their two souls hain’t made right to ever be intimate
with each other.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">LANDING IN THE EMERALD ISLE.</p>

<p>Wall, after all, as much as I wuz afraid of the
deepness and length and breadth of the ocean, I
had a pretty good time, after all.</p>

<p>Somehow, I got to feelin’ that the ship wuz a big
city, and I got to feelin’ as if it wuz about as safe as
the land.</p>

<p>We d’no what is a-goin’ on under us on land&mdash;no,
indeed, we don’t, and if we git to forgittin’ it, we
often git a shake-up and a hunch from old Mom
Nater to let us know that we are entirely ignorant
of what she’s a-doin’ down in the depths of the
earth.</p>

<p>Yes, we git shook up with earthquakes, or cyclones
lift us up and sweep us off, and hurricanes
and water-spouts are abroad, and cars break down,
and horses throw us out of wagons, etc., etc.</p>

<p>I’d bring up these consolin’ thoughts a sight
when I’d be a-layin’ on my narrer piller and
a-thinkin’ that only a few boards wuz between me
and&mdash;what? And I’d kinder shudder and turn
over, and try to forgit it.</p>

<p>How cold the water wuz and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>how deep, and how
lonesome it would be a-sinkin’ down, and down,
and down, and how big the shark’s mouth wuz,
and how the cold, bitter, chokin’ waves would wash
anythin’ to and fro like a piece of weed, and sweep
one so fur off and so fur down that it didn’t seem
as if the Angel of the Resurrection could ever find
us!</p>

<p>But I spoze he could.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that we could as well be found
in a shark as in some poseys that grow up from the
dust of our body, and whose perfume exhale in the
mornin’ dew goin’ up to the clouds, fallin’ in rain,
and goin’ through countless forms before the resurrection.</p>

<p>Oh! did I not bring up all these thoughts anon
or oftener? And did I not say to myself, time and
agin, for my comfort and consolation, “The One
who formed me out of nothin’ is able to reform
me.” Yes, my best comfort wuz to ask the One
who careth for ’em who go down to the sea in
ships to care for me, and to rest in that thought.</p>

<p>To lay down in the depths of that wide love and
care and repose myself in it.</p>

<p>Wall, we had a pretty good time on board.
There wuz lots of different kinds of folks there,
jest as there always is on land.</p>

<p>I had hearn that there wuz a live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> English Lord
on board, and Josiah picked him out the first time
we went on deck.</p>

<p>Yes, there he wuz, as we spozed, a tall, slim,
supercilious-actin’ and lookin’ feller, who ordered
round the ship’s crew, and wuz dissatisfied with his
food, and snubbed the ocean, and felt that it hadn’t
no need to breathe so loud, and looked askance at
the Heavens if the day wuz dull.</p>

<p>Yes, he looked down on everybody and everything.
And Josiah sez&mdash;“He can’t help it, he wuz
brung up that way; he is a Lord.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “Lord or not, he acts like a fool!”
Sez I, “He might lower his nose once in awhile to
rest it.”</p>

<p>Truly, he held it right up in the air the hull of
the time.</p>

<p>But come to find out, that feller wuz a Grocer’s
clerk, who wuz a-makin’ his first trip, and felt as if
Heaven and earth wuz a-watchin’ and admirin’ his
move.</p>

<p>And the Lord we found out wuz a short, square-built
man, dressed in rough tweed, so jolly and full
of fun that his wife had to hold him back all the
time.</p>

<p>She would have been glad to had him put on
some dignity and things, but he wouldn’t.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_157.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>The lord with a pink paper suit on.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One night some pretty American girls give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> a
dance, and they handed round some little favors
that looked like big nuts, and when you opened
’em a hull tissue-paper suit come out on ’em, and
that Lord come out with a pink paper suit on, and
went round through the dance half bent, for the
skirt wuz but short, with a woman’s ruffled cap on,
and a dress.</p>

<p>His wife seemed to suffer agonies. Her pride
ached, I spozed. But his didn’t; he wuz as happy
as a lark, and didn’t put on any more airs than
any common medder lark would.</p>

<p>I liked him first-rate, but that clerk wuz austere
and exclusive to the last. He wouldn’t mingle
with us.</p>

<p>He wuz a-travellin’ abroad. And, to use a common
adage, usually applied to horses&mdash;“He felt
his oats.”</p>

<p>Wall, they got up a paper on board and printed
it on a typewriter&mdash;the Lord furnishin’ most of the
jokes for it.</p>

<p>And then they had a peanut-party, and the Lord
carried the most of anybody on the back of his
hand and got the prize&mdash;3 long strings of glass
beads, and he wore ’em all the evenin’, to his wife’s
horrow.</p>

<p>But the clerk, whose father kep’ a peanut-stand,
and who had dwelt with ’em all the days of his
youth, he thought it wuz a vulgar party, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
looked at peanuts as if he knew ’em not.</p>

<p>There wuz times when the sea wuz rough, and
Josiah and I retired to the cabin, and for hours
bemoaned our fate and wondered if we
should ever agin see the cliffs of Jonesville.</p>

<p>And on one heavey day, when the floor
of our cell seemed to rise up and smite us
in the pits of our stumicks, Josiah made
his will, and handed it to me, with a face
on which love and agony and fear appeared,
about a third of each on ’em.</p>

<p>Sez he, in a voice tremblin’ with emotion&mdash;“Take
my last tribute of love, and,”
sez he, “have it recorded, or it may be
broke.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, “dear Josiah”&mdash;for his
love awoke my own; it had been havin’
a nap while I wuz a-wrestlin’ with the elements, and
furniture that wuz a-tryin’ to upset me.</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“If you die, I, too, shall perish. So what
avails a will?”</p>

<p>He hadn’t thought of that, and sez he, a-speakin’
out feebly from his bunk with his eyes shet&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’re fat; you may float,” sez he; “my prize
shoat did that slipped out of the wagon fordin’ the
creek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, in the same faint axents&mdash;truly our two
voices wuz as feeble as a pair of feeble cats, and
weaker&mdash;sez I, “I always said you would twit me
of my heft on your death-bed if the subject come
up, and you had your conscientiousness.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “I’ve showed my love to you&mdash;I have
left you everything onconditional. You can marry
agin.” Sez he, “This is no time for selfishness and
jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Marry agin!” sez I feebly; “what do I want
of another pardner? Heaven knows, I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he tenderly, for my words touched
him&mdash;“you may feel different when you hain’t so
sick to your stumick.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “and you may, too!”</p>

<p>He had never made a will before that left me
onhampered, and I felt that when his legs wuz
firmer under him, and his stumick and head wuz
steadier, that he, too, might undergo a change.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>It wuz a bright, calm day. He felt well, and I
see him the next mornin’ a furtively tearin’ up that
will and a-strewin’ the torn bits out of the port-hole
winder.</p>

<p>As he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> so his hands got entangled in a cord
I’d made out of weltin’ cord.</p>

<p>And sez he, a-lookin’ down onto it&mdash;“In the
name of the gracious Peter! what is this?”</p>

<p>He thought in a minute of rope ladders and
troubadors&mdash;he acted jealous.</p>

<p>Sez I, “It is some handkerchiefs that I am
a-washin’ in the Atlantic Ocean, Josiah.”</p>

<p>He didn’t know I wuz awake, and it startled
him. And sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“How did you ever come to think on’t?”</p>

<p>“I d’no,” sez I; “but I thought it would be
sunthin’ to think on, to say I had used the Atlantic
for a washtub.”</p>

<p>Sez he&mdash;“Wash one of mine, Samantha. I’d
love to tell Deacon Garvin on’t.”</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“Your second best bandanna is on the
line.”</p>

<p>He looked down onto the heavin’ billows with
content, and sez he&mdash;“I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>That mornin’ the sea lay calm and beautiful.
The sun riz up on it and flooded it with delicious
waves of color; the east wuz a flame of color, and
the crest of the heavin’ billows wuz aflame with
gold and crimson and amethyst, and fur off some
tall icebergs loomed up like cold, pale ghosts,
a-hantin’ us with a vague sense of danger, like the
undertone of sadness that underlays all things the
most beautiful and grand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Then there wuz moonlight evenin’s, when the
moon shone down full and clear, and the glorified
sky and the glorified water seemed to be a part of
each other, and the long and deep rythm of the
waves seemed to bear us up with ’em in a grand
hymn that all creation wuz a-chantin’.</p>

<p>And then there wuz misty days, when clouds of
fog settled down round us like gray, mysterious
wings, a-holdin’ us clost in their folds of mystery,
when we knew not what wuz a yard in front of
us; when we sailed on, blind creeters, not a-knowin’
what we wuz a-comin’ bunt up aginst&mdash;a iceberg,
or another ship, or jest the open space ahead.
When the cries of the fog-horn seemed to be a-hollerin’
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Git out of the way, we’re a-comin’!”</p>

<p>But how could a iceberg hear and wheel round?
No, it hadn’t come down from the pole for no
sech a purpose, it wuz a-goin’ straight ahead.</p>

<p>Them wuz solemn times, and we would think
that we couldn’t never forgit ’em.</p>

<p>But we did. When the sun shone bright agin, we
wuz ready to forgit the sorrer and danger of the
night and be happy agin. And at times, fur off on the
fur, watery plain&mdash;fur off ahead, we would see a sail.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer it would come, and then go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
by us and dissapear in the horizen back of us&mdash;meetin’
and partin’ at some distance without a
word; some like human bein’s goin’ by each other
on the ocean of Life. Separate worlds full of
human life and interest meetin’ and partin’, floatin’
by onbeknown.</p>

<p>I took a strange and a mysterious comfort sometimes
a-bendin’ over the sides of the ship and
lookin’ fur down into the depths of the water and
a-seein’ huge forms a-playin’ down in their strange,
green depths, or imaginin’ I could. And I took
a kind of dretful enjoyment a-ponderin’ on what
would foller on and ensue if I should fall off
and plunge down into the liquid depths. But
them thoughts wuz too full of or to indulge in
long. They driv me back to the side of my beloved
pardner, or the society of little Adrian and
Alice.</p>

<p>Adrian knew everybody on board, and everybody
loved him. But, above all, he liked a sailor
called Mike. From all I could learn, that seaman
racked his brain to tell all sorts of wild sea stories
to the child.</p>

<p>I d’no as I’ve told about Josiah’s appetite durin’
that voyage. My pardner’s appetite wuz always
a strong subject, but now it wuz exceedingly queer.</p>

<p>After he got over his seasickness, most the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
words he said, and they come right after his “good-by”
and partin’ words to me, though some time
after&mdash;he waked up out of a deep sleep, and the
first words he said to me wuz, in middlin’ feeble
axents&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you spoze, Samantha, I could git a little
biled beef and cabbage, and some pork and beans?”</p>

<p>He had been a-livin’ on water gruel, and the
words almost startled me. But I obtained the
ingregients with some trouble, and as I bore them
in, a large platter full of each, he looked up dretful
feeble and languishin’, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Set ’em down by the bed, Samantha, and
mebby I could eat a bean, or part of one.”</p>

<p>“Part of one bean” didn’t sound very encouragin’,
but I set ’em down, and the next time I
see them platters, about ten minutes afterwards,
they wuz both clean as though they had been
swept and garnished.</p>

<p>And from that minute he gained on’t. My own
first hankerin’ after I got better wuz for a biled
dinner. Of course, I couldn’t git that, but I exchanged
milk porridge for roast pork, and sassige,
and cabbage hot slaw the first thing, and
felt satisfied and happy with the change.</p>

<p>Curous, hain’t it? If I’d been on land I believe
they would a-killed me, but I thrived on the
diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Wall, I never shall forgit how good the land
looked to me as I looked fur forrerds over the
heavin’ billows of blue, and see the beautiful green
shores of Queenstown a-risin’ up ahead.</p>

<p>Adrian said, “Auntie, is that the Emerald Isle,
and are the hills all covered with emeralds, like
Alice’s ring?” Sez he, “Mike told me they
were.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Don’t you pay any attention to what
Mike sez. The hills are jest covered with soft,
green grass that would look enough sight better to
me than any jewelled stuns would.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi stood motionless, lookin’ on the fair
seen ahead, as if he wuz a-lookin’ over the Swellin’s
of Jordan into the Promised Land; part of the
time that riz up look rested on Alice’s sweet face.</p>

<p>Alice and Martin wuz a-walkin’ arm-in-arm up
and down the deck, as much took up with the
sight as we wuz, only Martin thought it looked
more wise to not act tickled and enthuastick
about it.</p>

<p>That is the first rule in etiket with some folks, to
not act tickled and glad about anything, but to
look as stunny and onmoved at a masterpiece of
Art, or a towerin’ Alp, as at a plate of cold ham.</p>

<p>Josiah, he wuz a-worryin’ about the tug that wuz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
to take us on shore.</p>

<p>“A tug!” sez he; “I don’t like that name, it
don’t sound reliable. If it is a good convenience,
why is it sech a tug to it to carry us?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Be calm, Josiah, everything will come
out right.”</p>

<p>And sez he, “One of the passengers called it a
‘tender.’ If it is so tender, I don’t believe it is
safe. Tenderness means weakness,” says he.</p>

<p>“Not always,” sez I, “quite the reverse.” But
I see that it wuz no time to plunge into metaphysicks
and prove to him what I knew well, that
“the bravest are the tenderest&mdash;the lovin’ are the
darin’.”</p>

<p>Then sez he, “If we ever live to git into that
tug, we have got to have our baggage all overhauled
by the Custom House Officers.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “what of it? We hain’t nothin’
to conceal or cover up.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “that dressin’-gown of mine will
jest as likely as not be all throwed round and
mussed up. It worries me!” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Don’t worry, Josiah Allen; it is good
rep, and it will stand a good overhaulin’ and not
hurt it.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “them tossels can’t be handled
over by all Ireland and come out hull and sound.
It is nothin’ but dum foolishness to have to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
through all them performances.”</p>

<p>But his worryin’ wuz worse than the reality.
For anon we sailed into Cork harbor, and got into
the tug that come out to meet us. The officers
jest give our things the lightest examination possible.
They didn’t throw things around at all,
and they wuz real polite, only in one thing&mdash;they
asked us if we had tobacco or sperits.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp60" id="i_166" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_166.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>With a stern look, calculated to wither him.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Josiah never took his eyes offen that dressin’-gown
through the hull of the ordeal, and he
wuz foldin’ them tossels lovin’ly as soon as they
dropped his satchel, when I wuz lookin’ back and
a-wonderin’ at the size of the steamer that loomed
up above us some like a cliff.</p>

<p>As I say, the man with the officers asked me if
I had sperits or tobacco in my luggage.</p>

<p>I confronted him with a stern look, calculated
to wither him, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do I look like it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Look like what?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Like a old toper who carrys round whiskey
and a pipe?” Sez I, “I never drink a drop
stronger than coffee, half cream, and I never
smoked a pipe in my life, only once I smoked a
little mullen for asthma.”</p>

<p>He felt ashamed, jest as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> wanted him to. He
see the power of principle, and he didn’t hardly
touch my things.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz no wonder that Josiah worried
some. These things were new to us. He and I
wuz, as you may say, the
only students and novices
in travellin’ in the hull
party, for Al Faizi had
been everywhere, his conversation
wuz enriched by
allusions to every land.</p>

<p>And Alice had been to
Paris to school for three
years. And Martin had
took her over and went
after her. He often spoke
of his familiarity with foreign
life and the exhaustive
study he had made in
foreign fields. “There
wuz little left for him to
see,” he claimed.</p>

<p>He had took Alice over and went after her,
but went with lightnin’ speed only when he
wuz bed-sick. So Alice told me with her own
lips.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>
<p>He boasted a sight of his intimacy with foreign
ways and customs.</p>

<p>Wall, did it not seem good to set our feet on
land once more! But I wuz almost ashamed to see
the way my pardner reeled round, for he acted for
all the world as if he had been a-drinkin’. I wuz
jest a-goin’ to mention it to him when he whispered
to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hang on to me, Samantha,” sez he; “I will
never tell on’t in the world.”</p>

<p>“Tell of what?” sez I, as I made a effort to
stand up straight and strong.</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “if you took a little too much
sling for that cold of yourn, I hain’t one to throw
it in your face.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “That Stewardess wuz always a-recomendin’
it.”</p>

<p>“Sling!” sez I coldly; “I hain’t took a drop of
anything stronger than tea, and,” sez I, “knowin’
my principles as you do, I should think you’d be
ashamed of yourself to misuse a pardner in this
shameful way!”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “you can’t walk straight to save
your life! and,” sez he, “you grew so indignant on
the tug at that man, that one would almost mistrust
you.”</p>

<p>I see that there wuz some reason in his talk, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>too much indignation looks like guilt, lots of
times.</p>

<p>Sez I, “You talk about my reelin’ round; what
are you doin’?” sez I, as his knees crooked and he
crumpled down like one intoxicated.</p>

<p>Wall, he gin up that it wuz the effects of the
ship, and erelong we were in a good, clean tarvern
and had breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast we wuz indeed glad to lay down
and rest for a little while, and then, as the rest of
the party had all sallied out, my Josiah and me
took a walk all to ourselves, or that is what we had
lotted on.</p>

<p>But of all the droves of beggars that follered us,
I never see the beat&mdash;nasty and shiftless and talkin’
and teasin’ the very life out on us.</p>

<p>I gin ’em a few cents in order to git rid on ’em.</p>

<p>But the more I gin the more they follered on.
So I jest shet up my portmoney and put it into my
pocket.</p>

<p>Josiah poohed at ’em and didn’t give a cent, and
didn’t approve of the three cents I’d expended.</p>

<p>Till one old woman whispered to him, and I
hearn her say&mdash;</p>

<p>“I see, young man, that you are good to your
old mother; won’t you for her sake give me a
shilling?”</p>

<p>He wavered&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> almost gin it to her. Sez she&mdash;“I
will pray for blessin’s on your handsome
young head.”</p>

<p>He handed her the shillin’ with a happy, foolish
look, which lasted till she come round to my side,
and she whispered to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“My pretty young lady, give me a sixpence.
Your poor old father has give me a gift, and do not
let your own young heart be harder nor his.”</p>

<p>His liniment darkened rapidly, and he hurried
me through the narrer streets, full of shops and tarverns;
and he did not console himself as I did by
lookin’ up on the steep hill and seein’ the handsome
residences&mdash;no, he seemed cut to the heart.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin said when we got back that we
would go up to Cork at once, as he wuz anxious to
see all he could in Ireland as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>He said that in a week at the outside he thought
we could exhaust all the sight-seein’ in Ireland and
git to the bottom of the “Irish Question.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “you’ll do well if you do that.”</p>

<p>And I didn’t make no moves to break it up, and
we wuz soon a-ridin’ through the beautiful green
country. And we seen on each side on us “sweet
fields arrayed in livin’ green.”</p>

<p>Never wuz there sech velvety grass, and the
roads wuz as smooth and as hard as a pavement.</p>

<p>Stun walls run along, with their soft, gray color,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
and anon a hedge, birds, and flowers would break
the seen. And little, low cottages covered with
vines dotted the landscape here and there; and
now and then a chapel would point its spire up
into the blue overhead.</p>

<p>Once in awhile a queer rig with seats rigged out
back to back, drawed by horses, and full of folks,
and once in awhile a smaller cart drawed by a
donkey, and once in awhile a woman with a red or
blue cloak and a white cap, and a man with short
pantaloons and coat.</p>

<p>And so we rid on, green underneath, blue overhead,
until we arrived in Cork.</p>

<p>Wall, we put up at the Imperial Hotel. Everything
wuz clean and sweet about the house, and we
had plenty to eat, and that wuz good. It wuz indeed
a comfort. And the waiters wuz dretful civil
and eager to please.</p>

<p>It beats all, the difference in their actions here
and in Jonesville.</p>

<p>I’ve had Irish wimmen work for me who seemed
to look down on me, and accepted their dollar a
day hautily; but here they would thankfully receive
their sixpence a day, and treat you like a lady, too,
which is more ’n half the battle.</p>

<p>Queer, hain’t it? But human nater is human
nater, and even a little child, if she has been tyranized
over by her Ma, will misuse her dolly or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
cat. I spoze that trait in nater can’t be helped
from caperin’ when it gits a chance.</p>

<p>Wall, the next day Martin said he “wanted to
go to Blarney Castle for several reasons.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say what they wuz, but I spoze one of
’em wuz that old reason of hisen about wantin’ to
do what other folks did. And then, mebby, he
wanted to try to palaver better than he had palavered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Tenny rate, we all set out for the castle
next mornin’ after breakfast.</p>

<p>We went in what they call a “jauntin’ car.”
The passengers sot back to back, but as my Josiah
wuz placed by my side I did not mind it.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp84" id="i_171" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_171.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>We went in what they call a “jauntin’ car.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>On one side sot we two, and Al Faizi, on the
other Martin and his children.</p>

<p>Wall, the view wuz enchantin’ beyend description.
The road wuz as smooth and level as smooth glass,
bordered by hedges full of pure white and other
colored poseys, a-fillin’ the air full of perfume, and
the cottages and every old tower and ruin wuz covered
with the glossy green of the ivy.</p>

<p>It wuz a fair seen&mdash;a fair seen!</p>

<p>Nater duz her best in Ireland, anyway. She
seems to delight to cover the meanest things&mdash;old
straw-thatched cabins, and stuns, and everything&mdash;with
a robe of the richest, brightest green; mebby
she wants to kinder make up to the Irish for what
they hain’t got, Jestice and comfort and sech, and
mebby, agin, it is the moist climate.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">A VISIT TO BLARNEY CASTLE.</p>

<p>Anon we reached the old castle, for when anything
gits to be six hundred years old you can well
call it old. Why, I should call Josiah dretful old
if he wuz over six hundred years old.</p>

<p>It towers up considerable high&mdash;a hundred feet,
anyway. Some of its walls are eight or ten feet
thick. Al Faizi asked what they had sech thick
walls for.</p>

<p>And Martin told him it wuz built so to keep
enemies from breakin’ in and killin’ the inhabitants
of the castle.</p>

<p>He looked dretful thoughtful, and then he
asked what made them big holes in the walls.</p>

<p>Martin said that Cromwell made ’em 200 years
ago. Sez Martin, “Cromwell made the land red
with blood.”</p>

<p>“Was he not a great religious leader among your
people?” said Al Faizi&mdash;“a Reformer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he not preach the doctrine of peace, love
to your enemies, good will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course he did,” sez<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> Martin.</p>

<p>“Why did he kill so many men, then?” sez Al
Faizi.</p>

<p>“To make the other men behave themselves,”
sez Martin.</p>

<p>“Kill them to make them act better?”</p>

<p>“The Catholics and the Protestants both fought
in the name of their religion, and tortured and killed
and slaughtered thousands and thousands of men
and women.”</p>

<p>“For the sake of religion?” sez Al Faizi. And
he took out his book and wrote rapidly for awhile,
but he didn’t say nothin’.</p>

<p>“It was a case of killing or being killed,” sez
Martin. “It was a religious war.”</p>

<p>“A religious war?” sez Al Faizi dreamily.
“Where was His teaching, the divine Christ, ‘Love
your enemies, do good to them that persecute
you’?”</p>

<p>“That won’t work,” sez Martin; “those words
are good in peace, but in danger they don’t work
worth a cent.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi looked up slowly to Martin’s face; in
his eyes wuz a shinin’ light, a softness, a tenderness
sech as made his face shine, and underneath it all
wuz a sort of a innocent, wonderin’ look, which I
spoze would be called primitive and oncivilized.</p>

<p>Martin’s face looked commercial and successful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
sharp and shrewd, and what he called civilized.</p>

<p>I had quite a number of thoughts as I looked on
the two men, over a dozen and a half, anyway.</p>

<p>Alice and Adrian wuz pickin’ some of the green
ivy sprays, and they brung ’em to me and wanted
me to look at ’em.</p>

<p>Sez Alice, “Some of this ivy that grows here so
wild and luxuriant&mdash;acres of it, it seems to me&mdash;is
just the kind that we see little slips of in our green-houses
at home; do you see how beautiful it is?”</p>

<p>And she held up a few of the glossy leaves to Al
Faizi.</p>

<p>He glanced at it, and then beyend into her sweet,
uplifted face.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see how beautiful it is,” he sez softly, and
he ended his words with a deep sithe.</p>

<p>And a shadder settled down over his face, and he
turned to his writin’ agin.</p>

<p>As for Alice, she see nothin’, but kep’ a-gatherin’
her ivy sprays and a-singin’ to herself in her low,
sweet voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“I give thee an ivy leaf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Only an ivy leaf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, wear it forever, love, nearest thy heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I knew very well who she wuz aposthrofizin’ in
her own heart entirely onbeknown to her as she wuz
hummin’ over little snatches of the song and
a-pickin’ the glowin’ green sprays. And I knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
that the affection and constancy that dwelt in her
soul wuz as deathless as that ivy and fur more
clingin’ and beautiful.</p>

<p>Martin had climbed up to the elevation where
the Blarney Stun hung suspended two feet below
the surface, fastened by iron clamps.</p>

<p>But he wouldn’t resk his neck by bein’ lowered
down to that place, but he kissed a little chunk that
layed on the ground inside the castle, for I see
him.</p>

<p>And so did Josiah, though I didn’t advise him to.</p>

<p>Josiah, a-lookin’ up from below, had been makin’
calculations on how he could be lowered down to
the big Blarney Stun on the ruff.</p>

<p>Sez he, “It wuz a oversight in me not takin’ a
rope; but,” sez he, all rousted up, as his ardent, impulsive
way is, sez he, “I might take that mantilly
you’ve got on.”</p>

<p>It bein’ a cool day I’d worn it.</p>

<p>“And you, and Martin, and Fazer could hang
holt of one end, and tie the other end round my
waist. I could be lowered down and kiss it and
not git a hair of my head hurt.”</p>

<p>I glanced pityin’ly at his bald head, and sez I
coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>“How would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> it be with the tabs?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” sez he, “it might stretch ’em a little, but
if a pardner wouldn’t be willin’ to resk a tab for
her husband, she can’t think much on him.”</p>

<p>And he prepared to mount the steep, a-holdin’
out his hand for the mantilly.</p>

<p>I stood still, foldin’ my tabs round me more
clost.</p>

<p>Sez he, “You talk a sight about your feelin’s for
me, and now you put a mantilly ahead of ’em. I
hain’t equal in your mind to a tab,” sez he bitterly.</p>

<p>A thought struck aginst me. “No, Josiah,”
sez I, “you use my mantilly to-day, and to-morrer
we will come back, and I will use the tossels on
your dressin’-gown.” (They wuz stout ones&mdash;stout
as a rope almost.)</p>

<p>He looked dumbfoundered. “Use them tossels?”
sez he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I; “you can’t think much of me if
you put them tossels ahead of me.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “Them tossels hain’t a-goin’ to be used
to lift a ton’s weight. I might as well give ’em up
to once as to misuse ’em so.”</p>

<p>“Then I hain’t as much importance in your mind
as a tossel?” sez I; and he admitted that I wuzn’t
half so good lookin’.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “less gin up the idee, both on us.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “Didn’t you bring sunthin’ to eat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
you? I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>So I gladly led him away from the stairs leadin’
to Danger and Blarney, and we found a good, clean
spot, and spread out our refreshin’ lunch that we
had brung with us to refresh ourselves with, and
Josiah did indeed do jestice to it; but that dear
man always duz do that, at home or in more foreign
climes.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Wall, the day passed away with no particular
coincedences.</p>

<p>We went home by another road that led through
the valley, by meetin’-housen and horsepitals, jails,
etc., and amongst the rest we see Father Mathew’s
statute.</p>

<p>And if you’ll believe it&mdash;but I don’t spoze you
will&mdash;all round the statute of that man, who spent
his hull life a-fightin’ aginst intemperance, is a hull
lot of drinkin’ places. As if they calculate to keep
right on a-tormentin’ even his statute.</p>

<p>But they’ve no need to try it, good old creeter!
He himself has got beyend the toil and the heart-aches
caused by others’ sin and weaknesses.</p>

<p>He has got to the place where he is not plagued
and heart-broken by the sight of that sin and folly,
for what duz it say&mdash;</p>

<p>“There are no drunkards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> there.”</p>

<p>Good old soul!</p>

<p>Keep on a-sellin’ your accursed stuff right under
the marble nose of his statute if you want to, or
pour whiskey over it, you can’t git nigh to him,
this hero, this martyr, who give his life, and has now
found it in glory.</p>

<p>But to resoom.</p>

<p>Wall, the next mornin’ we sot off in a carriage
for Killarney.</p>

<p>There wuz some sort of a meetin’ that day, and
the bells wuz a-ringin’ as we rode along.</p>

<p>Mebby amongst ’em wuz the Bells of Shandon.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t wonder; I sort o’ listened to the
sound of ’em with my soul, but I d’no as I could
recognize ’em so’s to tell ’em from the other bells.</p>

<p>Our souls hain’t learnt our mortal ears yet, as it
would love to, as it will in the futer.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though I could hear as we rode
along the Bells of Shandon.</p>

<p>And thoughts of what I’d seen in a face the
day before kinder chimed in with the sweet, melancholy
sounds.</p>

<p>As it happened, Al Faizi sot by me, and I,
a-feelin’ that I had a duty to do, and a-layin’ out
to do it if I got a chance, I kinder brung the conversation
round to Alice; and as I spoke of her
sweetness and charm, the strangest look come into
his eyes you ever see, and he sez to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>me, jest as
though I wuz a-beholdin’ his secret thoughts onbeknown
to him&mdash;“I have a vow&mdash;I am wedded to
the cause of truth.”</p>

<p>He said it with a deep shadder settlin’ down over
his glowin’ eyes. And then with Duty and Pity
a-bolsterin’ me up on both sides, I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Alice is engaged to another feller.”</p>

<p>He looked full at me as curous a look as I ever
see in my life&mdash;what did I see in his eyes, or ruther
what didn’t I see? I see Religion, Devotion,
Deathless Human Love, warm, glowin’, eager Renunciation,
Pity for himself (I could see plain that
he wuz sorry for himself&mdash;sorry as a dog), Eager
Zeal, Pity for the hull world layin’ in wickedness.</p>

<p>It wuz a strange look.</p>

<p>And I never said anythin’ to him, only the look
I gin him in answer, where deep pity and admiration
and respect blended about half and half. And
a motherly look of full comprehension and sympathy
a-shinin’ out a-tellin’ him that I knew all, and
pitied all, and would never tell anybody what I
knew.</p>

<p>We had volumes of conversation in jest them two
looks, and no one wuz the wiser&mdash;I told nobody.</p>

<p>But, indeed, this secret knowledge added a ingregient
of as deep curosity as wuz ever carried round
by a menagerie as a side show, for me to transport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
round from place to place, or wherever we pitched
our tent on our tower.</p>

<p>Yes, truly, things wuz in as curous a state as I
ever see, so fur as the affections and sech wuz concerned.</p>

<p>Alice a-bein’ wropped up in the thoughts of her
feller, and her father a-bein’ determined to not let
her so much as think on him.</p>

<p>Al Faizi wropped up in Alice, speakin’ to nobody
only in the soul language of the eye, anon or oftener,
and nobody but me a-knowin’ it, but I a-knowin’ it
for certain.</p>

<p>Alice a-bein’ adored by a heathen!</p>

<p>Queer feelin’s it gin me and queerer still to read
in that heathen’s eyes the knowledge that she had
nothin’ to fear from him&mdash;she would never have
even an appeal to her pity in futer days.</p>

<p>As she sot by her husband’s side a-holdin’ a baby’s
head on her bosom, she would never look down
into its sweet eyes and think with pity of lonely,
despairin’ eyes that wuz facin’ a lonely, empty
futer.</p>

<p>No; that heroic soul kep’ its own secrets. Why,
you can be a hero in anything&mdash;even boots and
galluses, and sech, if you bear pinchin’ from ’em
without complaint (Josiah never could, he groaned
audibly and frequent unless his galluses wuz jest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
right).</p>

<p>And Adrian, a happy little soul, pleased with
everything, and a-praisin’ himself up jest as calm as
he did castles and cathedrals, and jest as innocent.</p>

<p>And Martin a-bearin’ himself up with dignity,
near-sighted as ever when it come to recognizin’
American bores and curous tourists.</p>

<p>And Josiah and I in our usual attitude of rapt
devotion to each other, which is our two most
striking traits (a good deal of the time they be).</p>

<p class="h2sub">KILLARNEY, DUBLIN, AND A WAKE.</p>

<p>Martin said that he wouldn’t for the world
have folks ask him if he had visited the Lakes of
Killarney, and have to say no.</p>

<p>And I believe that thought kep’ him up through
all the long day’s journey and the two nights and
one day we spent there.</p>

<p>I don’t believe he had any deeper feelin’s and
more riz up ones when he looked at them three
beautiful lakes, with the mountains a-standin’ up all
round ’em with bare heads.</p>

<p>Yes, you’d think them old mountains had took
their green caps off and wuz lookin’ down on ’em
with deep reverence and respect. They wuz so
exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_184" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Three beautiful lakes.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Martin, mebby, can’t be expected to be as riz
up and as elevated as them peaks; anyway, he acted
out his nater, which wuz to see everything he could
see, to stand round with his hands in his pockets if
he felt like it, or if he wuz kinder tired, to lean back
and shet up his eyes and rest and have his body
dragged along through the places, so’s he could say
he had been in ’em.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>
<p>And Al Faizi acted out his nater, which wuz to
stand like a devotee before a shrine as the beauty of
them seens busted onto him.</p>

<p>And in noticin’ that the rich, highly cultivated
lower lands layin’ about the lakes wuz all fenced in
with high walls, and that one or two men owned
hundreds and thousands of acres, sacred to the use
of some animals they wanted to hunt down for
pleasure once or twice durin’ the year, while
hundreds and thousands of poor human bein’s wuz
starvin’ all round the borders of these immense
estates.</p>

<p>Livin’ in miserable, rotten cabins, so poor that
one of these rich men would not think of lettin’
one of his beasts stay in ’em for a night. Immortal
souls for whom Christ died hungry, starvin’ for a
crust and dyin’ for a bit of the luxury that wuz
wasted upon dumb brutes.</p>

<p>In noticin’ this, Martin sithed to think that them
men wuzn’t to home, so that he could call on ’em.</p>

<p>He said that he would love to say that he had
met ’em.</p>

<p>But Al Faizi, after askin’ all he could about the
estates of the two or three wealthy men and the
thousands of starvin’ ones round ’em, looked
dretful thoughtful, and took out his little book
with the cross and star on’t and writ a lot <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>in it.</p>

<p>And Martin spoke of its bein’ jest as bad in the
north of Scotland, where the Crofters can hardly
git enough food to keep from starvin’. And they
live in sech huts as no man would keep his animals in.</p>

<p>Big families of boys and girls huddled together
like pigs in one small room, with a open fireplace
in the middle, with no chimney and no ruff, nothin’
but rotten straw; the smoke blindin’ their eyes,
and nothin’ to eat hardly.</p>

<p>And as miserable as this hovel is, the landlord is
liable to turn ’em out at any time to make room
for happier and better cared-for animals&mdash;sheep,
deer, etc., etc.</p>

<p>As Al Faizi hearn this his face looked sad and
thoughtful, and he wrote down quick a good deal
in that little book of hisen.</p>

<p>I think Martin liked it. He thought he wuz
takin’ notes of his conversation, and he felt big
over it, but I don’t believe it wuz anything personal
that Al Faizi writ. I believe it wuz sunthin’ as
deep as jestice and as pure as love and pity that
he wuz a-writin’ about; anyhow, his face wuz a study
as I watched it. There wuz indignation in it and
pity and love, and another look, that I felt instinctively
wuz a-lookin’ forrered to jedgment.</p>

<p>Lookin’ forrered not many years to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>the time
when things would be different.</p>

<p>Wall, we stayed there and went round part of
the way in boats, and part of the way in wagons
all of the next day, a-lookin’ at the beautiful gems
of lakes in their settin’s of richest emerald, and in
little walks about the country, and in comparin’
the heights of luxury to the depths of squalor and
misery.</p>

<p>Not fur from here wuz the cottage where Kate
Kearney used to live. You know who she wuz,
I spoze.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For did you not hear of Kate Kearney?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She lives on the banks of Killarney;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the glance of her eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shun peril and fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For fatal’s the glance of Kate Kearney.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whether he flew from her I d’no, but presoom
he didn’t, men are so sot in these things.</p>

<p>Peril and danger hain’t a-goin’ to make ’em fly
from a pretty woman&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>In the lower lake, on an island, wuz the ruins of
a big castle, picturesque and ivy-covered. It wuz
owned by the O’Donohues. And the boatman
said that every seven years the chief of the
O’Donohues come back for a night to see his
castle.</p>

<p>I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> to myself, mebby he come oftener
than that, but didn’t say a word, not wantin’ to
do anything to either make or break a legend hundreds
of years old.</p>

<p>Wall, we wuz a-layin’ out to leave there the next
mornin’, but Martin, by his pryin’ round, found
that there wuz a-goin’ to be a wake that night in
a cabin not fur from the tarvern where we wuz
a-stayin’, and by payin’ some money&mdash;I d’no how
much&mdash;he got a chance to attend to it, and he
said that Josiah and I could go if we wanted to.
He told me he didn’t spoze that Al Faizi would
care about goin’, and he wanted Alice and Adrian
to rest, for the next mornin’ early we wuz to set
out for Dublin.</p>

<p>But I thanked him real polite, and told him
that “I would stay with the children.”</p>

<p>And afterwards, seein’ that Al Faizi wanted to
go, them three men sot off.</p>

<p>A old man had passed away, and they wuz
a-makin’ a great wake for him.</p>

<p>They didn’t stay long, for they said that the
whiskey and drinkin’ and tobacco-smokin’ in the
little hovel drove ’em out.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_189" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_189.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Drinkin’ and tobacco-smokin’ in the little hovel drove ’em out.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Martin observed complacently that he would
be glad to say that he had been to a real Irish
Wake.</p>

<p>Al Faizi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> spoke of the old wimmen wailers, and
said that they had jest sech professional mourners
in Egypt and parts of Africa, and he wondered
quite a good deal how that custom come way off
here in this fur-off Ireland, but he spozed that it
wuz in some way brought here from the East.
Mebby it come down from them old days nobody
knows anything about, of which relics remains in
them old round towers, etc. So old nobody knows
who built ’em, or what for.</p>

<p>He wondered a good deal, but didn’t take out
that book of hisen with the star and cross on’t.
No, he writ in another book with a plain Russia
leather cover on’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>My pardner restrained himself until the others
had departed to their couches, but I see that he
wuz fearful agitated and excited.</p>

<p>And sez he, the minute they went out&mdash;</p>

<p>“I tell you, Samantha, it wuz a excitin’ seen,
and,” sez he, “what a excitement it would make
in Jonesville if we should have one!” Sez he
dreamily&mdash;</p>

<p>“Uncle Nate Bentley is over ninety; there
might be one arranged easy.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Josiah Allen, don’t you go to lookin’
forrered to any sech doin’s!”</p>

<p>“Why?” sez he; “if I should leave you, you
could probble git the Widder Lummis up to Zoar
and Drusilla Bentley to wail for a little or
nothin’.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Josiah Allen, no widder or old maid is
a-goin’ to wail over you by my hirin’ ’em to; if
they wail, it will be at their own expense.</p>

<p>“You will have one true mourner, Josiah Allen,
whose grief will be too deep and heartfelt to display
it before a crowd, with whiskey and tobacco
as accessories.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t expect you’d have any drinkin’ or
smokin’. I knew your principles too well. They
might smoke a little catnip, or sunthin’ of that sort,
or pass round some lemonade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, “There will be nothin’ of the kind done,
Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>But he sprunted up and sez, “You seem to be
settlin’ things all your own way. I should think
that I ort to have some say in it. Whose funeral
is it, I’d like to know, we’re talkin’ about?”</p>

<p>But I sez, “I don’t want to hear another word
of sech talk, and I won’t.” And I riz up and sallied
off to bed, and in sweet slumber that man soon
forgot all his stylish ambitions.</p>

<p>Wall, the next day we sot off to Dublin, and
havin’ arrived there with no casualities worth mentionin’,
we settled down in a good-sized tarvern,
and after a little rest we meandered around to see
the sights of the place.</p>

<p>Martin said that he wanted to visit the great
manafacturys where Irish Poplin is made, as he had
some friends who wuz interested in that trade, and
that it would be expected of him.</p>

<p>And I then mentioned to Josiah, seein’ that he
wuz right here at the headquarters, perhaps it would
be best for me to buy a gray poplin dress. I knew
it would last like iron.</p>

<p>But Josiah said with deep earnestness, that if I
only knew how much better he liked my old gray
parmetty dress to home I never would speak
on’t. Sez he, “You look perfectly beautiful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> it,
and there is so many associations connected with it.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I should think there would be, seein’
I’ve worn it stiddy for upwards of eighteen years
without alterin’ it.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “it is a perfect beauty, and you
look lovely in it.”</p>

<p>He hadn’t been so complimentary to me for upwards
of fourteen years, and I wuz touched by it,
and gin up the thought of gittin’ a new dress.</p>

<p>Oh! how many, many wimmen have done the
same thing under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>But the numerous shops wuz full of the loveliest
goods of all kinds, and politer creeters than them
clerks I don’t want to see.</p>

<p>St. Patrick’s Cathedral wuz of course one of the
first places we visited. They say that this wuz
built, in the first place, by St. Patrick himself about
fourteen hundred years ago, but if that wuz so, I
thought St. Patrick would feel sorry for the filth
and wretchedness that surrounded the meetin’-house
up to the very door.</p>

<p>There wuz a magnificent carved marble sarcophagus
of Archbishop Whateley, with his own
marble figger stretched out on top of it.</p>

<p>And a monument to that kinder queer, kinder
mean, smart chap, Swift, and a tablet to poor
Stella, who would a-done better if she had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>married
some other feller, mebby not so smart, but better
natered and a better provider.</p>

<p>Poor creeter, I’m sorry for her!</p>

<p>There wuz lots of other interestin’ monuments
and memorials, but Time and Martin wuz in a
hurry, so we did not delay.</p>

<p>We visited Trinity College, the castle, the beautiful
part of the city where the rich folks lived, and
the Liberties, where it seemed as if all the liberty
the poor creeters had wuz the liberty to be jest as
poor and degraded and nasty as they could be.</p>

<p>There wuz beautiful parks, one on ’em over
eighteen hundred acres in it, full of beauty, and we
see lots of statutes, erected to the great men who
had been born in Dublin&mdash;the Duke of Wellington,
the great orator, Daniel O’Connell, etc.</p>

<p>The monument to Nelson, the hero of the Nile,
is one hundred and ten feet high before he stands
up on it, and he is 11 feet high.</p>

<p>He is in a sightly place.</p>

<p>If his sperit comes back in some still moonlight
night, and looks over the world with him, I wonder
if it ever looks over the mistakes he made? I wonder
if the beautiful Lady Hamilton ever comes
into its thoughts?</p>

<p>She hain’t got any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span> monument.</p>

<p>I wonder if he’s sorry for it, that he stands up so
high and she so low in the opinion of people&mdash;so
low, when once he felt it his greatest glory and
happiness to kneel at her feet?</p>

<p>But such surmises are futile, futiler than there’s
any need on.</p>

<p>To resoom.</p>

<p>Charles Lever, the novelist, wuz born in Dublin,
and so wuz Tom Moore.</p>

<p>We went to the birthplace of Moore.</p>

<p>It wuz a common-lookin’ buildin’, though it had
a bust of the poet in front up between the winders.</p>

<p>The lower part of the house wuz used as a
grocery store, and Josiah himself proposed that we
should buy here some little souvenir of the poet.</p>

<p>I wuz dumbfoundered. I never knew him to
propose any outlay of the kind before, and I sez
as much.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I knew you wuz always wantin’
to buy sunthin’ to remember sech romantic
places by, and I thought here would be a good
chance.”</p>

<p>I wuz so touched by his thoughtfulness that I
sez&mdash;“Dear Josiah, what had you got it into your
head to buy?”</p>

<p>And he said that he thought a few crackers and
a little cheese and a herrin’ or two would be as
good as anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Did you mean to keep ’em, Josiah?” sez I, for
a dark suspicion swept over me.</p>

<p>And he owned up that he layed out to nibble
on ’em a little on the way back to the hotel.</p>

<p>I see right through it, and I didn’t fall in with
his overtoor. Somehow, herrin’s and cheese seemed
incongrous with Lally Rooks, and Peris, and Paradises,
and I told him so.</p>

<p>And he sez, “Dum it all, they had to eat in
Paradise if they kep’ alive, and,” sez he, “a Peri,
if she knew anything, wouldn’t object to a slice of
good cheese and some soda crackers.”</p>

<p>So I told him that if he wanted sunthin’ to eat to
buy it; but, sez I, “never veneer a selfish thought
with the fine gold of romance and tender memories.”</p>

<p>And he said that he didn’t want nothin’ to do
with varnish of any kind, he wanted some cheese
and crackers. So he bought a few, I guess; I
didn’t watch him.</p>

<p>I myself wuz quite took up with lookin’ round
the place, sanctified by genius of a certain kind, and
I murmured almost onbeknown to myself the
words I had hearn Tirzah Ann repeat. She always
loved Moore fur better than Thomas J. did.
Though Thomas J. thought well enough on him, but
Tirzah Ann used to rehearse and sing him by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> the
hour, so in spite of myself I had learnt lots of his
poetry by heart.</p>

<p>And as I looked round the room I found myself
entirely onbeknown to myself a-hummin’ over the
“Last Rose of Summer,” and the “Meetin’ of the
Waters,” and the “Harp that once through Tara’s
Halls.”</p>

<p>That last one Tirzah Ann ust to sing a sight,
and I always liked to hear it, though I never got it
into my head jest who Mr. Tara wuz, or what line
of business he wuz in.</p>

<p>Wall, knowin’ that Tirzah Ann would prize it so
high, I bought some choclate drops of candy to take
home to her.</p>

<p>They wuz as sweet as Moore’s poetry, and softer,
some.</p>

<p class="h2sub">JOSIAH AS A BANSHEE.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin said that he should probble be
asked if he had visited the Giant’s Causeway, so he
thought we had better proceed to it to once. So
we went directly from Dublin to Port Rush. We
stayed there all night, and the next day we all went
out on the electric car, for Martin said that he
wanted Adrian to go, for in futer years he would
probble be asked if he had been there. Adrian
wuz tired out and didn’t want to go&mdash;he wuz real
cross about it.</p>

<p>Alice told her Pa that Adrian said that he
wouldn’t look at anything if he went, but Martin
said that it would be better for him to go, even if
he didn’t see anything, for then he could say that
he had been there. So we all sot off&mdash;the way we
went wuz a perfect sight and wonder in itself, for
what power do you spoze it wuz that rolled the
wheels that took us onwards?</p>

<p>It wuz all done by a waterfall at Bush Mills, a
few milds away. The water that poured down
from the hills is harnessed, as you may say, and
made to carry us along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>Queer, hain’t it? And shows that you never can
tell what will happen to you in the futer.</p>

<p>Why, if anybody had told them little free,
sparklin’ rivulets that leap along up in the hills,
foamin’ and chatterin’ of liberty and freedom, and
sech&mdash;if anybody had throwed it into their bright,
sparklin’ faces that they wuz a-goin’ to be ketched
and tackled up with some kind of riggin’ and carry
Josiah Allen’s Wife and her pardner, and the world
at large, them rivulets would have resented it&mdash;they
would have laughed and gurgled and swept on indifferent
and onbelievin’.</p>

<p>But so it wuz, they had to come to it.</p>

<p>And after they got broke in they didn’t seem to
mind it, for they bore us on so smooth and easy
and noiseless, that it wuz a perfect treat.</p>

<p>No steamin’, no smokin’&mdash;they learnt that up in
the hills. It wuz a comfort to ride after ’em.</p>

<p>And we had nothin’ to hender us from thinkin’
of the Giants and talkin’ about ’em.</p>

<p>Josiah said that he had always approved of
giants, and that he would love to see one or two of
’em.</p>

<p>Adrian didn’t git real reconciled to goin’ till
after we got started, then he got real excited, and
got the idee that we wuz goin’ to see Jack the
Giant Killer, and asked me quite a number of questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
about it.</p>

<p>Runnin’ sunthin’ like this&mdash;How big wuz the
Giants, and where did they come from, and what
wuz their names, and how long did it take ’em to
build the Causeway, and&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is the Causeway made of?”</p>

<p>“Of rocks.”</p>

<p>“What are the rocks made of, and who made the
rocks, and when were they made, and how, and
what for?”</p>

<p>Good land! I wuz tuckered out, and told him I
guessed I would look out of the winder a spell and
take the air.</p>

<p>And then he wanted to know what air wuz
made of, and who made it, and if there wuzn’t
any air out of the winder if I could make some air.</p>

<p>He didn’t ask so many questions as a general
thing&mdash;he seemed to be kinder fractious that day.
Poor little creeter, he wuz tired out, and I knew it,
and I encouraged him to kinder lean up aginst me
and take all the rest and comfort he could.</p>

<p>Alice wuz real happy. She’d got some letters
that mornin’, and two big ones wuz in one handwritin’&mdash;I
knew it. She read ’em over two or three
times in the train.</p>

<p>Al Faizi looked at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>her as she read ’em, and his
face looked queer&mdash;he see the glow on her face, and
I see that, like the sun, that bright light could cast
a shadder. Sunshine and shadder, how they chase
across the landscape of life! How clost they foller
each other! What strange picters they make!
What thoughts they give!</p>

<p>But to resoom&mdash;we got to the Causeway in pretty
good season, and we found it wuz a sight, a
sight.</p>

<p>It is made of high round columns, or pillows, and
you can walk on it jest as you could on the walk
Josiah made out to the hen-house out of bricks sot
long end up.</p>

<p>But this Giants’ walk is fur, fur immenser than
Josiah’s. It is so extremely big that they say the
Giants built it. It runs out into the sea in a kind
of a curous shape, and is a sight to behold.</p>

<p>I thought I wouldn’t go and see the caves that
wuz nigh there. You had to go to ’em in a boat&mdash;and
as I looked on that boat, and considered the
size on’t, and then subtracted the size of it from the
bigness of the Atlantic Ocean, I gin up that I
wouldn’t tackle it.</p>

<p>I had done some of my multiplyin’ and subtractin’
out loud, onbeknown to me, and Josiah hearn me,
and said he guessed he wouldn’t go. He looked
round the Heavens and earth as if to find a suitable
excuse, and finally he sez&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“It seems so kinder muggy to-day, I guess I
won’t go, though I should enjoy the trip immensely
if it wuzn’t for the clost atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Wall, I wuz glad to have him gin it up
on any account.</p>

<p>Al Faizi didn’t seem to care about
goin’, nor Alice, nor Adrian.</p>

<p>But Martin said that he wouldn’t want
it to be said that he hadn’t visited the
caves.</p>

<p>So he sot off with a couple of boatmen.</p>

<p>There wuz a dretful sort of a heavey
look to the Atlantic, and I wuz glad that
I didn’t venter, for I felt truly that the
Giants, if they ever heard on’t, would make
allowances for my feelin’s in not dastin’ to
venter out on the Atlantic in a boat.</p>

<p>As it turned out, glad enough wuz I
that there didn’t none of the rest on us go,
for there come up a sudden squall right
when Martin wuz in the cave, and they had to hurry
out for their lives. The rough waves wuz a-washin’
the boat up aginst them hard pillows of stun, and
they wuz in sech danger of their lives that the boatmen
had to jump out on the rocks the best way
they could, and haul Martin, more dead than alive,
up over the rocks.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Drippin’ wet when he come back.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He wuz drippin’ wet when he come back to the
hotel, and I sez, “Martin, how sorry I am you ventered
out there!”</p>

<p>And he sez, with his teeth a-chatterin’ and the
water a-drippin’ off of him, that he wasn’t sorry, for a
friend of hisen, a very rich and very influential man,
had been caught in jest the same way.</p>

<p>And he gin me to understand that he anticipated
a great treat in talkin’ over the experience with
him.</p>

<p>Wall, there is sunthin’ in that&mdash;there is comfort
in talkin’ over past troubles and dangers, and I
couldn’t dispute it.</p>

<p>But I sez: “For mercy sakes! do change your
clothes and git dried off.”</p>

<p>But he hadn’t any other clothes with him, and
the upshot of it wuz, he had to go to bed while his
clothes wuz dryin’.</p>

<p>But Josiah wuz sorry for him, and blamed himself
for not thinkin’ to bring along his dressin’-gown.
Sez he, “I wouldn’t think of lendin’ it on a common
occasion, but,” sez he, lookin’ round on sech
big work as the Giants had done there, sez he, “I
wouldn’t want to act small, and refuse to let Martin
put it on for an hour or two.”</p>

<p>Wall, as soon as Martin wuz dried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> off, we sot sail
back to Port Rush, and it wuz there that night that
I had a severe trial and fright.</p>

<p>We had had a good supper, and Josiah had eat
more than wuz good for him, I believe, and drinked
too much coffee.</p>

<p>He is used to tea at night, but bein’ so wore out
and kinder chilly, Martin ordered strong coffee.</p>

<p>And I believe that coffee wuz to the bottom of
our trials that night.</p>

<p>Bein’ kinder fagged out, Martin had gone to his
room early, and the rest had follered his example,
and my pardner and I had also sought the seclusion
of our quiet bedroom.</p>

<p>And I immegiately and to once begun my preperations
for slumber.</p>

<p>I onfolded my nightgown and laid it over a chair
and ondone my sheepshead night-cap, and mekanically
went to sort of flutin’ the border between my
fingers, as I sot there, and I begun to feel real
drowsy.</p>

<p>But Josiah didn’t seem to be sleepy a mite. He
had donned that dressin’-gown of hisen and tied the
strings in a large bow-knot, that showed off the red
tossels to the best advantage, and walked 2 and fro
several times, and seemed to look and act real sentimental.
He has sech spells&mdash;I guess all men do at
times. And finally he leaned back in a big arm-chair
and kinder hummed over some tunes&mdash;not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
sech tunes as I would approve of his singin’, but
some songs&mdash;such as “Ben Bolt,” and “Lorena,” and
“She’s all my Fancy painted Her.”</p>

<p>And finally he broke out quite loud a-singin’&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I’ll chase the antelope over the plains,</div>

</div>

<p>“What is it, Samantha, that he said he’d do to
the tiger’s cub&mdash;‘with a chain’?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Choke it, mebby&mdash;I presoom he’d be
skairt enough to want to.”</p>

<p>“No; it wuz sunthin’ like harnessin’, Samantha.
Do you know what it is? It comes right in the
turn of the tune, and it hampers me to forgit it.”</p>

<p>And then he begun agin&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The tiger’s cub I’ll <i>tie</i> with a chain&mdash;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The tiger’s cub I’ll, folderol, with a chain.’”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“‘And the wild gazelle, with its silvery feet,</div>

</div>

<p>Sez he, “I’ve got it all but that one word, and
that&mdash;that will come to me,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I feel like singin’ to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> Samantha.”</p>

<p>“Sing!” sez I in icy axents; “I’d call it singin’, if
I wuz you.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “if I dast to let my voice out,
you’d hear singin’, but it would wake ’em all up.
My voice is powerful, and I feel in full voice to-night.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “I’m glad that sunthin’ holds you
back.</p>

<p>“And,” sez I, “I am beat out and I am goin’ to
bed.”</p>

<p>And so I got ready and went to bed.</p>

<p>The rest wuz all asleep, so I spozed.</p>

<p>Wall, I fell asleep most the first thing, and I
d’no how long I’d slept, when I hearn a knockin’
at my door, and I got up, and Alice stood there,
white and tremblin’.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp69" id="i_206" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_206.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Alice stood there, white and tremblin’.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“The Banshee!” sez she in tremblin’ tones; “I
saw it myself, and heard it.”</p>

<p>Sez she, “You know this is the very part of Ireland
where they have them.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You’d been a-thinkin’ of ’em and imagined
it.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” sez she; “I was just falling asleep
when I heard those awful wails of distress, and I
got up and went to father’s room, which is next to
mine, and he got up and looked out of the window,
and he saw it and heard it too.” Sez she, “You
know the Banshee always appears before some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
dreadful trouble comes to a family, and it seems as
if it is meant for us, for it is only a little ways off.”
Sez she, “You and Uncle Josiah get up and come
into my room, and you can see it for yourselves.”</p>

<p>At them words there
seemed to come to me a
realizin’ sense of my surroundin’s;
bein’ jest waked
up with news of a ghost,
I’d overlooked the fact of
my companion’s absence.</p>

<p>But I sez, “I will come,
Alice. Your Uncle Josiah
has probble heard it, and
gone out to investigate.”</p>

<p>So I throwed on my
flannel wrapper and slipped
on my shoes and put
my breakfast shawl round
me and went into Alice’s room. There we found
Martin wrapped in his Pegama, or whatever they
call it.</p>

<p>Alice’s winder commanded a better view than
hisen, and he stood motionless by the winder.</p>

<p>Al Faizi and Adrian wuz in the other side of the
house, and so wuz the rest of the folks. These two
rooms wuz kinder built out on the side by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, “Martin, you don’t believe anythin’ of
this kind, do you?”</p>

<p>But Alice spoke up before he could answer,
“Why, at Dunluce Castle that we saw to-day there
is a Banshee that always foretells death to the family,
and they have them all over Ireland.”</p>

<p>Sez I, advancin’ towards the winder, “You don’t
believe anythin’ of this kind, do you, Martin?”</p>

<p>He answered evasively, “There is something dreadful
queer-looking down there across the road&mdash;it is
standing still now, but it has been giving the most
blood-curdling sounds and wails that I ever heard.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Alice, “the Banshee always gives
those same terrific screeches and harrowing yells. I
know it is a Banshee, and it is for us, father, for
it appeared to us.”</p>

<p>And she commenced to cry. I guess her first
thought was of somebody that wuz in her mind the
hull of the time.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Hush up, Alice&mdash;I don’t believe anything
of the kind.”</p>

<p>But as I looked out, follerin’ Martin’s solemn and
silent pint, I did see a sight that made the cold
chills run down my back in spite of myself, and
goose pimples gathered freely down my shoulder
blades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>I see a dark figger a-standin’ up on a little rock
that riz up there above the rest of the ground; it
stood motionless, and, indeed, it looked skairful.
And onbeknown to myself I sez&mdash;“For the land’s
sake! what is it?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp58" id="i_209" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_209.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A dark figger a-standin’ up on a little rock.</p></div>
</div>

<p>My own voice wuz tremolous with fear, and
Alice see it, and cried harder than ever. And Martin
sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“You ought to have heard the terrific screams
the thing gave if you want to be scared&mdash;seeing it
isn’t nothing at all to hearing it.</p>

<p>“And,” sez he, “I’ll go and call up the hotel-keeper
and find out what it is. Maybe it is a
lunatic broken out of some asylum. I am going
to know something about who and what it
is.”</p>

<p>But jest at this minute the creeter broke out in
one of its wild cries, and Martin and Alice shuddered,
and sez he, “Did you ever in your life hear
anything so awful?”</p>

<p>And Alice sez, “I cannot bear it, Aunt Samantha.
It is too terrible.”</p>

<p>But there wuz to me sunthin’ familiar in the
sound, and I lifted the sash, and the words come in
plain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“Bind with a chain!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tiger’s cub I’ll <i>bind</i> with a chain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the wild gazelle”&mdash;etc., etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sez I, “It is my own pardner with his dressin’-gown
on, and a-singin’.”</p>

<p>The words Martin said then I won’t never tell&mdash;no,
indeed! besides the wickedness on ’em, it wuz
too humiliatin’ to hear ’em applied to my own pardner.
“Fool” wuz the last one of the three, and
“The” wuz the first one, but I will not tell the
middle word&mdash;you can’t make me.</p>

<p>Alice went to laughin’ (partly hysterics); she felt
dretful relieved, and as the figger seemed now to be
aproachin’ the house, I went back into my room,
into which it soon entered in a gay and jaunty
manner.</p>

<p>He had been enjoyin’ himself first-rate, and
sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, Samantha, I’ve found the word, and I’ve
been a-singin’;” sez he, “I sung the verse all over,
and it sounded beautiful, and then I stood still a
spell, and all of a sudden the right word come to me.
It wuz ‘bind,’” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I coldly, “You’ve skairt a woman almost
into fits and made a church-member and a relation
swear like a pirate.” Sez I, “I’ve seen you took
for lots of things, Josiah Allen, from first to last,
but I never thought I should ever live to see the
day to see you took for a ghost&mdash;a Banshee. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
common ghost would sound as good agin as that.”
And I went on and related the facts. He acted
mad and puggilistic like, and sez he&mdash;“I can’t help
folks from makin’ dum fools of themselves.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I wish you’d kep’ yourself from it.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “It is a pity if a man can’t sing a little
durin’ the evenin’ without his folks actin’ like perfect
fools!”</p>

<p>“Sing!” sez I; “I wonder how many more
episodes you’ll have to go through without your
learnin’ the truth about what you call your singin’.”
Sez I, “You can’t sing, Josiah Allen, any more than a
cow can play on the melodian, and I’ve told you so
often enough for you to believe it.”</p>

<p>“Wall, wall,” sez he, “it’s time to go to bed.
When a man is a-travellin’ with a hull crew of loonaticks
and fools, it stands him in hand to git what
little rest he can, nights.”</p>

<p>That man wuz ashamed of his conduct, and I
knew it.</p>

<p>Mortification works out sometimes in jest that
way. It gaulded him to be took for a Banshee, for
I hearn him mutter the word two or three times
scornfully, as he wuz a-ondressin’.</p>

<p>Sez he, “A Banshee!!! Dum fools!!! I’d love
to be one a spell&mdash;I’d show ’em some screechin’!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>
<p>He didn’t mean me to overhear him, but I did,
and I sez calmly from my piller&mdash;</p>

<p>“You needn’t blame yourself, Josiah Allen; there
hain’t a Banshee in Ireland but what would be proud
to mate with you after hearin’ you to-night&mdash;there
hain’t one on ’em that could outdo you.”</p>

<p>“Keep on your aggravatin’,” sez he, and he didn’t
say another word for as much as three minutes, when
he begun to complain of bein’ chilly.</p>

<p>And I took alarm to once, and made him some
hot lemonade&mdash;I had the ingregiences, and a alcohol
lamp with me.</p>

<p>And I folded up my woollen shawl, and tucked
him all up in it, and spoke real soothin’ to him, and
affectionate. For sech is the mystery of human
love, though pardners may mortify you, or anger
you, yet their sufferin’ or danger shows how strong
are the ties that bind two lovin’ hearts&mdash;nothin’
can break it. He answered me back in the same
affectionate way, though terse, but showin’ the tender
regard he had for my welfare. Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“For mercy sake, do come to bed! your feet will
be as cold as ice suckles.”</p>

<p>And so sweet peace havin’ descended down onto
us, we wuz both soon wropped in slumber.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin concluded that we would go <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>as soon
as we could to Glasgow, “For,” sez he, “I feel
that we have seen everything that there is to see
in Ireland, and gone to the bottom, as you may
say, of the ‘Irish Question.’ So we might just as
well go to Scotland as soon as might be.”</p>

<p>So we proceeded to Glasgow, partly by train and
partly by steamboat.</p>

<p>Martin talked comfortably agin, on the train, of
havin’ seen everything in Ireland, and of havin’ gone
to the bottom of the “Irish Question.” “For,”
sez he, “the land is governed admirably&mdash;splendid
standing army, admirable police force, and as for
the people,” sez he, “in good seasons, statistics
show that there is half a ton of potatoes to each
person. More than I consume,” sez he complacently,
leanin’ back with his fingers in his vest
pockets.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Mebby you’d consume more potatoes if
you didn’t consume nothin’ else.” Sez I, “You
take out your fowls, and fish, and beef, and lamb,
and puddin’s, and pastry, etc., etc., etc., and eat
nothin’ but clear potatoes, and how many do you
spoze you’d consume, and how much comfort do
you spoze you’d take consumin’ ’em?”</p>

<p>He looked lofty, and sez he: “That isn’t a
parallel case.”</p>

<p>“And,” sez I, “when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span> the potato crop failed,
what then?”</p>

<p>Agin he sez, “That isn’t a parallel case.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Parallel to what?”</p>

<p>And he said, “Don’t you want the window shut
awhile? Let me put your shawl round you; it is
a little chilly.”</p>

<p>And then he went on talkin’ to Alice as fast as he
could about the seenery, and I wuz too well
bread to say anything more.</p>

<p>But I see that Al Faizi had took out his little
book with the jewelled cross on it, and he wuz
writin’ in it.</p>

<p>And from the way the light from above fell on it
as he held it, the rays streamed out from the jewelled
cross some like the flashin’ rays from a sword.</p>

<p>He had spoke to me before about the wretchedness
and beggary of the people, and expressed wonder
that one or two men should own hundreds of
thousands of acres and keep it for idle pleasure
grounds, while all round were men who couldn’t, no
matter how sober and industrious they might be,
buy enough land to build a shed on.</p>

<p>He had looked dreamy and strange while he
talked it over, but, as his usual way wuz, he didn’t
blame nothin’ nor nobody&mdash;that wuz the difference
between me and him.</p>

<p>He would seem to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> about and find out about
things, and then jest write ’em down in that book
of hisen. His face a-lookin’ calm a most all the
time, but dretful earnest and deep and sorrowful, a
good part of the time. His writin’ wuzn’t nothin’
hard, I don’t believe, but comparin’ the doin’s here
with the things in his own land, I spoze.</p>

<p>I had noticed that he had wrote down quite a
good deal after he had hearn this conversation on
Home Rule, and how for hundreds of years a brave
people had tried to git the rule of their own land.
Not always makin’ wise efforts, I spoze, but brave
ones every time, and how the grand old man in
England had stood up for ’em aginst his own folks.</p>

<p>I see Al Faizi had writ down quite a considerable,
a-praisin’ Gladstone, for all I know. He never told
what he writ down or drawed our attention to it, no
more than the sun duz as it photographs the pictures
of the bendin’ trees and the flowers on the earth
beneath. Jest duz it, and that’s all.</p>

<p>The sun and Al Faizi did. That’s where I differed
some&mdash;I talked more. Wimmen do have to
talk once in a while&mdash;they’re made so, I guess, onbeknown
to ’em. And I said quite a good deal
aloud and found considerable fault, though I meant
not to be too hard on either side.</p>

<p>There’s always two sides to every story. Ireland
hain’t always right, I don’t spoze, no more’n

forth, there must be some fault on both sides before
they git through, anyway, sech as swearin’, kickin’,
etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>I hain’t got nothin’ agin Queen Victoria, and she
knows I hain’t. The Widder Albert is a good woman
and a good calculator, and has brung up her children
well, and has laid up for ’em.</p>

<p>And if ever any woman wuz a mourner for a
pardner, she’s been and is now.</p>

<p>But I can’t think she duz jest right in this case,
not to let the Irish people rule their own country.
It stands to reason that Josiah and I wouldn’t want
Deacon Gowdy to rule our house and farm, though
he’s a real likely man and a brother in the same
meetin’ house, and a good calculator.</p>

<p>But even if we didn’t do quite so well, we would
ruther tend to our own house and affairs&mdash;everybody
would. And I laid out to talk to Victoria on the
subject the first time I had a real set-down visit
with her.</p>

<div class="figright illowp89" id="i_217" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_217.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>I laid out to talk to Victoria on the subject.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And then if Deacon Gowdy took all the money
he could rake and scrape out of us, and spent it all
on his own place, that would mad us, too.</p>

<p>And like as not if he kep’ Josiah and me down so
poor that we wuz most starved, and he should try
to turn us out of our own house, and use that dear
place, sacred to us, and the door-yard and orchard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
for a home for his dogs and fightin’ roosters and
sech, why, I d’no if Josiah see me barefooted
and hungry, a-beggin’ Deacon Gowdy not to turn
me out of the house I wuz born in, and on an
empty stumick, too, I
d’no but he’d knock
him down and jump on
him.</p>

<p>And that would make
trouble&mdash;Miss Gowdy
wouldn’t like that, but
if she should come to
me with it, I should say
to her, “Let him tend
to his own business,
then, and let us alone.”</p>

<p>And if she should uphold
him and say we hadn’t no jedgment, and wuz
shiftless, and we couldn’t take care of our land, and
they had to do it because we wuz too indolent, and
slack, and sech&mdash;I’d tell her agin that it wuz none
of her business. Sez I, “If we run through with
our own property we can go to our own poor-house,
can’t we?</p>

<p>“But,” I’d say, “you needn’t worry; what encouragement
do we have to work and git things ahead
when we know you’d take all the profits of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
labor? You go off and tend to your own business,
and we’ll work hard enough, and lay up.”</p>

<p>And then, after freein’ my mind to her, if old
Gowdy wuz too bad off, I dare presoom to say I
should offer him some wormwood to make a poultice
of to show him that I didn’t have no malice
towards him, only jest wantin’ to have my rights
and be let alone. But to resoom.</p>

<p>We arrove in Glasgow with no fatal results
a-flowin’ from our voyage, and we put up at a good
sizable tarvern, where we had plenty of things for
our comfort and luxury.</p>

<p>Amongst the things of luxury, I counted the
water that I drinked from day to day, for I
found that it wuz water brung from Loch Katrine.</p>

<p>And when you remember Ellen’s Isle, as described
by Sir Walter Scott, is right there in Loch Katrine&mdash;you
may perhaps imagine the height and depth
of my emotions.</p>

<p>Why, the very water I sipped, and wet my front
hair with mornings before my lookin’-glass, may
have gurgled and murmured round the very isle
where Ellen Douglas dwelt in her father’s hidden
lodge, covered with ivy and Idien vines.</p>

<p>Martin sot a great deal of store on visitin’ the
great public buildin’s and the Cathedral, which is
nine hundred years old, and the University, big
enough for over a thousand scholars&mdash;I guess a
thousand and a half.</p>

<p>But I myself took more interest in visitin’ the
Necropolous, as they call their buryin’ ground, and
seein’ the monument riz up to John Knox. It towers
up towards the sky dretful high; but not so high
as John’s principles loomed up&mdash;not nigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>And I wuz dretful interested while in the city in
lookin’ at the statutes of Sir Walter Scott, and
James Watts, and David Livingstone, and Robert
Burns.</p>

<p>And seein’ the place where Sir John Moore wuz
born.</p>

<p>It wuzn’t any better place than Elder Minkley wuz
born in, to Jonesville, or Deacon Blodgett up in Zoar.</p>

<p>And as I looked onto the onpretentious walls I
methought how it wuzn’t likely at all when he wuz
a baby, his Pa a-puttin’ up pills and powders at the
time, his Ma a-holdin’ his little helpless, dimpled
form to her bosom, that he would grow up to be
sech a hero and die fur from her, over in Spain, and
“be buried darkly at dead of night.”</p>

<p>And be left there cold and still, fur from kindred
and loved ones&mdash;“Alone in his glory.”</p>

<p>Wall, here in this city I had a great and welcome
surprise&mdash;Martin made me a present of a Paisley
shawl; they wuz manafectered in a place nigh here,
and Martin got me and Alice one.</p>

<p>Men don’t realize sech things, but I knew, and
Alice knew, that she wouldn’t be old enough to
wear hern for twenty years yet. But then, as I told
her, she would grow up to it in time.</p>

<p>But she kinder laid out, as I could see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span> on coverin’
a lounge with it in her <i>boodore</i>, which means
her private settin’-room.</p>

<p>I seldom use foreign languages, but when I do, I
don’t think it is any more ’n right to translate it
for the benefit of ’em who hain’t had my advantages.
What would Philury, or she that wuz Submit
Tewksbury, know about a <i>boodore</i>? They’d
probble think it wuz jewelry or some kind of agin’.</p>

<p class="h2sub">ROBERT BURNS AND HIGHLAND MARY.</p>

<p>Wall, from here we took some excursions to
places of interest in the vicinity. One of heart-thrillin’
interest wuz to Ayr, and lasted two days, for
Martin said he wanted to see every spot connected
in any way with Robert Burns. He said he didn’t
care about readin’ his historys and sermons, but it
seemed to be the stylish and proper thing to do, so
he wouldn’t fail of doin’ it for anything. So we
sot off one mornin’ with great anticipations, and
each on us a satchel, for the forty milds trip.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz riz up in his mind about Sir William
Wallace&mdash;more so than he wuz with Burns.</p>

<p>For the “Scottish Chiefs” had been read by him
with avidity in his boyhood, and permeated his
fancy, and he still thought it wuz the most thrillin’
book that wuz ever wrote, exceptin’ “Alonzo and
Melissa.” “<i>That</i>,” he said, “never will be equalled
for heart-breakin’ interest.”</p>

<p>So as we journeyed along he talked a sight about
Wallace and that claymore of hisen. “Why,” sez
he, “it must have weighed 4 hundred or 5 hundred
pounds. What a man he wuz to wield it as he did
and cut down his enemies with it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “it would take two common
men to lift it, they say, and what a sight it must
have been to see him swingin’ that round his head
and mowin’ down his enemies jest as Ury would
mow down oats!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Josiah, I hope you are too good to enjoy
sech a blood-curdlin’ sight, if it ever took place, but
you must be careful about believin’ everything you
hear about Wallace. I suppose that, like King Arthur,
an old Illiad that Thomas J. ust to read
about so much, lots of things has been told about
him that never took place.”</p>

<p>“Take care, Samantha; I can stand a good deal
from a pardner, but when you go to doubtin’ William
Wallace, then is the time for a man to take a stand.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ll be a-doubtin’ ‘Thaddeus of Warsaw’
next. I wuz brung up on them books,” sez he,
“and on them books I take my stand. If I’d hefted
that claymore myself, I couldn’t believe in it any
more ’n I do.”</p>

<p>Sez I, a-tryin’ to bring him back into the plains of
megumness and reason&mdash;</p>

<p>“You know history sez that Wallace wuz a sheep-stealer,
in the first place. Don’t pin your faith onto
him too much, Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>“A sheep-stealer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Wall, I will pin up a heavy shawl between Josiah
Allen and the public for the next few minutes.
I guess I’ll hang up my Paisley shawl, that’s pretty
thick, and I too will withdraw myself behind it.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say when we emerged from behind
it, I wuz a-sayin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, wall, I spoze like as not he did own a
claymore, Josiah Allen, and I dare say it wuz a
pretty hefty one.” And then I turned the subject
off onto Robert Burns, and bagpipes, and sech.</p>

<p>Truly there is a time for pardners to stand their
ground, and a time for ’em to gin in. When they
see blood-vessels are on the pint of bustin’ and pardners
are chokin’ with rage&mdash;gin in to ’em if you can,
and keep your principles.</p>

<p>I allers foller this receipt, and it has bore me on
triumphant.</p>

<p>Truly great is the mystery of pardners.</p>

<p>Wall, Josiah got real sentimental a-talkin’ about
Wallace’s first wife, Marion, and his second wife,
Helen Mar. “You know,” sez Josiah, “Helen said
in them last hours&mdash;‘My life must expire with his.’”</p>

<p>And I sez, “Wall, it did at jest about the same time&mdash;she
died of a broken heart,” sez I, bein’ willin’ to
talk kind o’ sentimental with him, and soothe him
down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” sez Josiah, “and don’t you remember
what Bothwell said ‘as he raised her clay-cold face
from Wallace’s coffin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘They loved in their lives, and in their deaths
they shall not be divided’?”</p>

<p>Josiah was dretful sentimental at them reminescences,
but he gradually chirked up agin, and by the
time we come in sight of that tower of William
Wallace’s, in Ayr, more’n a hundred feet high, Josiah’s
sperits riz up almost as high as that tower.</p>

<p>Ayr is the seen of some of the most thrillin’
events of Wallace’s life. Here he would sally out
aginst his enemies&mdash;here he wuz took by ’em and
imprisoned. Here Robert Bruce and his troops
made it their headquarters for a spell, and so did
Cromwell and his army.</p>

<p>It is a dretful interestin’ spot on lots of accounts,
but on none of ’em so much as bein’ the birthplace
of Robert Burns.</p>

<p>The humble cottage where the immortal flower
of Genius sprung up like a tall white lily out of the
dust of the wayside&mdash;</p>

<p>This cottage is on the banks of Bonny Doon&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> immortal tenderness and sweetness of that
love meetin’ and partin’ has made the waters of
Bonny Doon ripple along full of the melodies of
the past.</p>

<p>In Nater there is a universal tendency to retain
the good and beautiful, and forgit the commonplace
and dreary. We forgit the steamin’ vats and big
cheeses Mary must have had to turn and lift at her
place of service, Gavin Hamilton’s, or, as Burns
called it&mdash;“The Castle of Montgomerie.”</p>

<p>We forgit all the toilsome labor that must have
turned Mary’s pretty hands brown and hard, and
made her slim back ache.</p>

<p>We forgit the achin’ “Ploughman shanks” the
laborer Burns must have carried sometimes to their
trystin’ place beside the Bonny Doon.</p>

<p>For though you may lighten the labor of ploughin’
by religious poems, like the “Cotter’s Saturday
Night,” or brave, heroic ones, like “Scots wha hae
wi’ Wallace bled,” or verses to “A Mouse” and
“A Mountain Daisy”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Yet to hold the heavy plough as it tore its long
furrows in the flinty soil wuz weary work, and the
back and arms of the poet must have ached as sorely
as any other ploughman’s.</p>

<p>But you forgit all that; they dwell here forever
care free, serene in glowin’ youth and beauty.</p>

<p>How near they seemed to me, these immortal
lovers, as I stood there lost in thought by the ripplin’
waters of the Bonny Doon!</p>

<p>The white clouds floated along in the same blue
bendin’ Heavens; the bright waters dimpled and
laughed along jest as gayly and crystal clear, and
their memory dominated all things above and
below.</p>

<p>Here they stood, happy youth and maiden, beside
the overrunnin’ Doon, that carries ’em on, and will
carry ’em on forever, through the land of Love and
of Fame.</p>

<p>She is a-lookin’ up with blue, love-lit eyes into his
eager, ardent face. He is sayin’ to her, as he did a

<p>Devotion! heart-breakin’ grief! death! eternity!

<p>Other thoughts come to us anon, or a little later&mdash;thoughts
of the labors and struggles of the poet to
make a home and respectable livin’ for his family.</p>

<p>The warm poet nater, endowed, as all true poet
souls are, with the fiery “love of love, and hate
of hate, and scorn of scorn,” tryin’ to make its way
in a practical, money-lovin’ age.</p>

<p>It wuz some like takin’ an eagle down from the
heights, and trainin’ it to become a barn-yard fowl,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>or breakin’ in a wild gazelle to churn in a treadle
machine.</p>

<p>It wuz hard work!</p>

<p>And the fashionable world, that took him up with
the interest it would give to a new toy of a novel
design, soon grew weary of him, and turned away
coldly from the strugglin’ poet, in his unequal conflict
with poor land, high rents, misaprehension,
poverty, and hardships.</p>

<p>No wonder he turned away from the world at
last and said to poor Jean (she that wuz Jean
Armour), the wife who had been constant to him in
evil and good report&mdash;</p>

cut up.</p>

<p>Wall, I spoze he did&mdash;some; but he wuz a good-hearted
creeter.</p>

<p>And anyway they overlooked it in the first place,
and ’em who worship his memory now look calmly
over them faults as if they were mere specks on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
blazin’ sun.</p>

<p>Why didn’t they do so then? Why didn’t they
take a few of the posies they scatter on his cold
tomb to-day (one hundred years too late) and lay
’em in the tired, hard-workin’ hands, toilin’ on at
Nithsdale?</p>

<p>Why didn’t they take a few bits from the banquets
they spread now to his memory (one hundred
years too late) and give it to the half-starvin’ poet
and his wife and little ones, while it would have
done some good?</p>

<p>Why didn’t they take a little of the immense
sums they spend in marble blocks and shafts to rear
monuments to him all over the world, to buy a few
comforts for himself and his loved ones?</p>

<p>For what did almost his last letter state, he had
writ to a friend askin’ some relief, for without it,
he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“If I die not of disease, I must perish of hunger.”</p>

<p>Heart-sick with the tyrrany of his employers, the
little minds about him, who mebby rejoiced to tyrranize
over and torment a soul so much above their
own. Heart-sick with the neglect of the world, he
fell asleep July 21st, 1795.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>
<p>About a month before his death he writ to a
friend&mdash;</p>

<p>“As to my individual self I am tranquil, but
Burns’ poor widow and half a dozen of his dear little
ones, helpless orphans. Here I am weak as a
woman’s tear, ’tis half of my disease,” etc.</p>

<p>I should think Scotland would be ashamed of
herself. I honestly should, to let her greatest pride
and glory die of a broken heart, caused by her neglect
and heartlessness, and then praise him up so
and spend sech sums of money on his tombstones,
and things (one hundred years too late).</p>

<p>But, then, it’s a trait in human nater. Scotland
hain’t the only country that duz it.</p>

<p>It is nateral to torment and torture the soarin’
bird of Genius, and pluck out the plumage from its
quiverin’ flesh one at a time&mdash;cut its feathers
down, hang weights to its wings, and act.</p>

<p>And then when the agonized and heart-broken
soul has took its flight out of the tortured body, to
stuff that soulless effigy with the softest and warmest
stuffin’ of praise and appreciation, put jewels in
the blind eye sockets, cover the cold breast with
diamond bright stars of praise, and lift it up on
high, up on top of the soarinest monuments they
can raise to its honor.</p>

<p>Too late, <i>too late</i>!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>
<p>But I am indeed a-eppisodin’; and to resoom.</p>

<p>Everybody in the village had sunthin’ to say of
Burns. Everybody wuz proud of livin’ in the place
his feet had once trod.</p>

<p>Them who looked the coldest on him when
livin’, or descendents of them who had wrung his
sensitive soul while warm and beatin’, and achin’
for sympathy&mdash;</p>

<p>Descendents of the big man of the village, “Holy
Willie” himself, who once would not have spoken
to his humble neighbor, or if he’d spoken at all,
they’d been words of insult that would have rankled
in the soul of the poet, now considered it their
greatest pride and honor to live in the country that
gave him birth.</p>

<p>The cottage is a low, long buildin’ only one
story high. And jest think of it, how many are
born in five-story houses that nobody hears from
afterwards. The roof is thatched, the floors are
stun, clean and white. A cupboard full of dishes
stood on one side of the room.</p>

<p>There wuz some letters that Burns writ with
his own hand. I thought more of seein’ ’em than
any of the other relicks. Letters that his own
hand rested on&mdash;his own ardent, handsome face
had bent over. What emotions they gin me; I
never can tell the heft and number on ’em.</p>

<p>Yes, the thought of Burns filled the place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> jest
as some strong, rich perfume fills the hull room
where it has been spilt.</p>

<p>I didn’t hear much of anything said about Miss
Burns (she that wuz Jean Armour), but I took
quite a considerable spell of time and devoted it to
jest thinkin’ about her. I didn’t think it wuz no
more’n right that I should.</p>

<p>I spoze she felt real proud to be the wife of sech
a great man, and it wuz a great thing. But, then,
she had her troubles. Poor thing! patient, hard-workin’
creeter! Washin’ dishes, mendin’ clothes,
takin’ care of the children, takin’ all the care she
could of her husband. And then when she got
him all mended up for the week, and as good
vittles for him as she could with what she had to
do with&mdash;then to have him a-writin’ verses to other
wimmen!</p>

<p>A-takin’ the strength her own pot-pies and puddin’s
had gin him, and a-spendin’ it all on writin’
verses to other females.</p>

<p>His heart a-beatin’ voyalent aginst the vest she
had newly vamped for some other “Chloris” or
“Clorinda” or etc., etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>A-walkin’ off in the stockin’s she had new heeled to
catch a glimpse of some “lassie wi’ lint white locks,”
so’s he could put her rustic beauty into rhyme.</p>

<p>A-throwin’ himself down in a good coat that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
she’d jest washed and fixed up, to look up into
the sky and apostrofize some other female up in
Heaven.</p>

<p>It must have been tough on Jean&mdash;fearful gauldin’
to her!</p>

<p>But, then, mebby she wuz willin’ to have the fire
of his genius catch a brightness and glow from
any object. And woman’s beauty wuz always, to
Robert Burns, what the very best kindlin’ wood
is to me when vittles are to be produced in a hurry.</p>

<p>Mebby she looked on it with a lenitent eye&mdash;most
likely she did, or she couldn’t thought so
much on him as she did.</p>

<p>I guess he wuz a good, tender husband to her,
and a good provider, so fur as his means went.</p>

<p>But thinks I, here is another sample of the
devotion and constancy of my own sect. I thought
on her about 17 minutes.</p>

<p>Other tourists may foller my example or not, jest
as they think best, but I done it, and am glad on’t.
But to resoom.</p>

<p>We then went to see the old Bridge of Ayr,
whose single arch connects each green shore. It
wuz over this bridge that Tam o’ Shanter rode on
the old mair Maggie, pursued by witches, “Wi’
mony an eldritch screech and hollow.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>
<p>And I eppisoded some. I have to in the strangest
places. I methought that the same furies that
pursued the drunken Tam is still sold in the same
old inn, and even in the very birthplace of the
poet.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp91" id="i_238" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_238.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>The same furies that pursued the drunken Tam.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same sperits of delerious fear, and senseless
terror, are bought and sold at so much a glass.
Poets live and poets die&mdash;empires rise and empires
fall, but whiskey has to be sold jest the same.
Drunkards race through their sottish lives, hag rid
by the furies of drink and debauch. And mairs
have to be rid to death, and have their tails cut
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “It wuz probble a witch that cut off
the mair’s tail.”</p>

<p>Till he answered me, I hadn’t mistrusted that I
wuz a-eppisodin’ out loud.</p>

<p>Sez I, “That is to tippify how drunkards abuse
their animals, most likely,” sez I, “and to show
that these foul sperits don’t have no power where
pure water is in full sway.</p>

<p>“The drink demon hates water,” sez I.</p>

<p>But Josiah sez&mdash;“Wall, wall! I didn’t walk out
here to hold a Temperance Meetin’!” Sez he sarcastickally,
“This hain’t a Total Abstinence Society!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It’s a pity there wuzn’t one here a hundred
years ago!” Sez I, “Probble it would have
saved poor Burns from a good deal that he went
through, and,” sez I, “it would be a-settin’ a different
sample before young folks from the one that
wuz sot, and is still a-settin’&mdash;a sample his genius,
and noble qualities, and his light-hearted good
nater tempt ’em to foller.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “Hain’t you got a Temperance
Pledge round you, Samantha, or some badges, or
some banners, or white ribbins, or sunthin’?”</p>

<p>Sez he ironacly, “I could carry a banner with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>‘Temperance’ or ‘W. C. T. U.’ on it jest as
well as not, and I’d ruther lug it round and be
done with it than to have to everlastin’ly hear on’t.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I soothin’ly, “we will go back now
and have a good lunch.”</p>

<p>And as we wended along, I meditated that mebby
I hadn’t gin enough thought to my pardner’s feelin’s.
For truly mortals have not now any more
than in the time of Burns the “gift to see oursels
as ithers see us.”</p>

<p>But I wuz upheld by thinkin’ I’d talked on
principle, and that is a dretful upholdin’ thought.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">EDINBURGH AND MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.</p>

<p>Wall, from Glasgow we went to Edinburgh, and
we found that that wuz a beautiful city, beautiful,
with the ancient castle perched up on the rocks
four hundred feet above, and old Edinburgh a-lyin’
at its feet, like old Vassals that gathers round their
Chieftan; all on ’em aged, but loth to part.</p>

<p>The streets of old Edinburgh are so narrer that
you can almost reach to both sides of ’em and touch
the houses.</p>

<p>The houses, with pinted ruffs and gabriel ends,
are quaint and picturesque in the extreme, and interestin’.</p>

<p>Between the new and the old is a gulf, as there
often is, but partly filled up with a R. R. Station,
and statutes and gardens and handsome bridges are
throwed acrost it.</p>

<p>New Edinburgh is laid out dretful handsome, with
broad, wide streets and handsome buildin’s, and
statutes and fountains and parks and everything
else that it needs for its comfort; and it might
have got along with less on ’em, it seemed to me.
I rode through ’em, for Martin always said he
wanted to view every city exhaustively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>And we did it every time we rid out with him;
I come home perfectly exhausted. He wanted to
see so much, so much, in sech a short, sech a very
short time.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Oh, dear me suz!</p>

<p>When Josiah and me went alone by ourselves we
took as much agin comfort, for though mebby I
didn’t see so many things, I see ’em much better.
My brain didn’t reel nigh so much, nor my spectacles
wobble so.</p>

<p>Why, with Martin I would no sooner git them
specs sot on anything, a steeple or anything, but
them poor specs would have to do as poor little
Joe did, that Dickens wrote about, “move along,”
and move lively, too.</p>

<p>I wuz sorry for ’em and for the eyes under ’em.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, I wuz!</p>

<p>Half of the time Martin wouldn’t look at the different
things at all. But he said that he had never
visited Edinburgh before, and that he wanted to
take in all the sights.</p>

<p>And I believe my soul wuz raced through every
solitary street that day we wuz out together.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel well when we got back to the
hotel, he seemed to sort o’ wake up or roust up.
I d’no as he had been sound asleep, mebby he’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span> been
in a deep study about sunthin’&mdash;about his money-makin’,
I guess. But his eyes wuz shet a good deal
of the time.</p>

<p>But he said, with a happy look, that we had accomplished
a great deal.</p>

<p>I knew he’d accomplished one thing, he had jest
about killed one female.</p>

<p>And my poor pardner! poor creeter! wuz not
his looks pitiful? He bore up in Martin’s sight
(that man is kinder deceitful, but I wouldn’t want
him to hear that I said it).</p>

<p>But when we wuz alone, he would take on, and
limp, more’n I believe wuz neccessary.</p>

<p>Sez I&mdash;“You’ve no need to limp, Josiah; you rid
most all the way.”</p>

<p>“Rid! I should think I had rid! I’m bed rid,
that’s what ails me! I never shall be good for
nothin’ agin. We’ve been four hundred milds sence
we sot out, if we’ve been a step!”</p>

<p>And he sunk down onto the bed and groaned
loud, so’s you could hear him quite a good ways.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “let’s bear up under it the best we
can&mdash;it’s all paid for.”</p>

<p>“What good duz payin’ for a thing do that kills
you?” Sez he, “When you’re killed, payin’ for things
hain’t a-goin’ to help you! Oh! if I ever set foot
on my farm agin,” sez he, “I’ll never leave it to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
to meetin’, or anywhere.”</p>

<p>No megumness here, as I could see, but I pitied
him and sympathized with him deeply.</p>

<p>Sez I, “It would seem dretful good, wouldn’t it,
Josiah, to see you a-comin’ in with two pails of
milk? It would be jest about this time you’d want
the milk scum for the calves.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” he groaned, “them happy
times wuz too happy to last; we didn’t appreciate
’em.”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I; “don’t you remember how you ust
to dum the calves, and barn chores?”</p>

<p>“I praised ’em always,” sez he stoutly, “and I’d
ruther milk my hull herd of Jerseys now this minute
than to eat!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I don’t believe I appreciated how happy
I wuz a-standin’ by the buttery winder, calm and
peaceful, a-washin’ dishes, or a-skimmin’ milk, and
a-seein’ the red sun a-sinkin’ low beneath Balcom’s
hill; and the sweet south wind a-wavin’ the mornin’-glory
vines, and my snow-white strainer spread on
the blossomin’ rose-bush under the winder. And
the sight of the barns lookin’ so good, and sort o’
settled down and at rest, and the hen-house, and the
ash-house, and the garden&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And how I ust to ketch the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>old mair,” sez Josiah,
“and we’d ride over and see the children after
the chores wuz done. Oh! happy days,” sez he,
“we never shall see you agin!”</p>

<p>“Yes you will, Josiah Allen,” sez I; “bear up,
and we will anon be back in our own peaceful home.”</p>

<p>And wantin’ to roust him up still further out of
his despondency, I sez, “You will enjoy that home
better than ever now, for how you will enjoy tellin’
Uncle Smedley all about what you see to-day, Josiah
Allen.”</p>

<p>He brightened up; “Yes, Samantha, if I ever
live to get home, it will be a treat to tell what we
went through, and,” sez he, “won’t Uncle Smedley
open his eyes when I tell him of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Alas! alas! I had done what I sot out to do. I had
lightened my pardner’s gloom, but wearisome wuz
the hours I spent a-hearin’ him rehearse what he
wuz a-goin’ to tell the Jonesvillians.</p>

<p>Oh, the peticulars, oh, the peticulars! It wuz
hard to tread the ground over under the rain of a
Martin, but it wuz harder still to hear ’em rehearsed
by the voice of a Josiah.</p>

<p>But of course I lived through it, or I wouldn’t
be here to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Martin always done the fair thing, so fur as gittin’
good places to stay wuz concerned, and we had a
plenty of everything for our comfort, only jest that
one thing&mdash;rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>But my onusual common sense learnt me that I
mustn’t expect to be to home and on a tower at
the same time.</p>

<p>And I felt quite grateful to Martin for invitin’ us
to go with him&mdash;a good deal of the time I did; and
I tried to do my part as well as I could. I kep’ a
eye on Adrian, and see that his clothes and feet wuz
dry, and see that he learnt his Sunday-school lesson,
and see that Alice took her cough medicine
every day; and when Martin took it into his head
to go off for a day or two, he felt easy about the
children, knowin’ my love and care for ’em couldn’t
be excelled and gone beyend by anybody. He said
it wuz a great care offen his mind, and made him
feel at liberty to go and come.</p>

<p>He had to see certain men on business in these
different countries where we went, and I presoom
he did feel better to know that the children had
some one with ’em that loved ’em while he was off
milds away for days at a time.</p>

<p>And Alice kep’ a-sayin’ every day that she
couldn’t have got along without me anyway. And
I presoom I wuz some company for her; anyway, I
loved her, and she knew it. You can’t hide sech
feelin’s under a bushel.</p>

<p>And lots of times I gladly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> <i>gladly</i> stayed to home
with Adrian while Alice went out with her Pa.
She would say so sweetly that it wuz too bad to
deprive me of the pleasure of goin’ out with her
Pa.</p>

<p>And I would say, “Don’t mention it, Alice; I
am perfectly willin’ to stay to home with Adrian.”
And Heaven knows I spoke the truth!</p>

<p>She would come home, the horses covered with
sweat, and Martin and herself all fagged out; but
the fagness of 20 hain’t like the fagness of&mdash;&mdash;more
maturer and older years.</p>

<p>And in the mornin’ she’d be ready for another
start.</p>

<p>Of course some of the excursions I gladly jined
in. I wuz glad enough to go to see Holyrood
Palace, once the home of Mary Stuart, Queen of
Scots&mdash;Miss Darnley, she that wuz Stuart.</p>

<p>The most interestin’ queen that ever walked down
the pages of history. A-walkin’ along with her big,
soft eyes bent kinder downwards under that cap of
hern, and her sweet face a-drawin’ men’s hearts
out of their bodies to foller her to the throne, or
the scaffold, as she trod onwards. Heaven pity her
for her sorrow! If she wuz true or false, she atoned
for her sin, poor thing! by the hardness of her
fate.</p>

<p>Poor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>Mary! poor Miss Stuart that wuz! I wuz
always sorry for her, and I always believed her cousin
Lizabeth wuz jealous of her.</p>

<p>You know Lib wuzn’t very good-lookin’, and she
wuz as vain as a pea-hen, and it gaulded her to
have her cousin praised up so to her.</p>

<p>Relations are dretful mean sometimes, they’re
dretful jealous of each other&mdash;cousins specially;
and though they don’t make a practice of beheadin’
the ones they are jealous of, yet they stab ’em
with the sharp, pizened daggers of detraction, lies,
hatred, envy, mean insinuations, total incomprehension
of their motives, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>So if you have to live nigh ’em, you might jest
about as well have your head cut off, and done
with it.</p>

<p>But to resoom. We see the rooms, not very big
either, that poor Mary, Queen of Scots, ust to
live in.</p>

<p>It made me feel real bad to see in what a condition
her rooms wuz kep’. Poor thing! it seems as if
she went through with enough while she wuz alive
to have some respect paid to her memory now, and
her rooms kep’ clean.</p>

<p>But they wuz dusty and dingy lookin’. The
curtains round the bed where that pretty head ust
to lay a-dreamin’&mdash;what?&mdash;wuz all ragged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>
<p>I wouldn’t have sech ragged things in my back
chamber. But, poor thing! I didn’t lay anything to
her; my rooms git out of order if I leave ’em for
three days. And if I wuz away for three hundred
years, mine would look jest as bad, and mebby
worse.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz dretful took up in lookin’ at them blood
spots in the anty-room, but I wouldn’t look at ’em.
Sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“If them stains are made new every few days
from beef creeters, hens, or etcetery, I certainly
don’t want to see ’em. And if they’re made by the
blood of that Italian Rizzio, I wouldn’t give a cent
to see ’em.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I’m sorry for him, but I don’t believe
he wuz what he ort to be. Anyway, he ort to known
he wuz a-makin’ trouble in a family; men ortn’t
to make pardners jealous of ’em if they can help
it. But,” sez I, after thinkin’ a minute, “I d’no as
he could help it. That fatal power Mary wielded
held him, poor creeter! and drawed him on to his
fate, jest as it did the jealous pardner, when the
time come.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowp100" id="i_250" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_250.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Wall, I had sights of emotions in that palace and
in the chapel adjoinin’, where we trod over the
graves of so many kings and queens once so high
and mighty, now nothin’ but dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Curous, curous, hain’t it? Wall, I went with
’em to visit the castle of Edinburgh. And the view
from them rampants wuz so wide and extended
that Josiah vowed he could see clear over to Jonesville.
I disputed him, but he said and stuck to it,
that he recognized the steeple.</p>

<p>I knew better, but it wuz a grand and sweepin’
view as I ever see, or ever expect to see. All Scotland
lay spread out before us, some as our old map
would if it wuz spread on the kitchen floor, and I
looked down on it from the top of the kitchen
table.</p>

<p>We see the room here where poor Mary, Queen
of Scots, gave birth to a prince, James VI., afterwards
James 1st of England. What she went
through in this room! For when her baby wuz only
eight days old it wuz let down in a basket from the
cliff. Jest think on’t, sech a little baby let down
four hundred feet; but it wuz to save his life, and
she stood it.</p>

<p>Here we see the crown that they said rested on
the head of Robert Bruce. And we see the place
where so many, so many politicians had their heads
cut off.</p>

<p>I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> like to hear sech talk, and I showed that
I didn’t by my mean. But I proposed that we
should jine Martin. He wuz a-settin’ down in
front of them rampants a-addin’ up a row of figgers
in a account book.</p>

<p>He said that it wuz some home business that had
to be attended to. As he put the book back in his
pocket, and proposed that we should start for somewhere
else, I sez, “The view is enchantin’ from
here, hain’t it, Martin?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he in a absent-minded way, without
turnin’ his head&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes; there! I forgot to add that last five
thousand dollars to the balance,” and he wrote it
down as we walked onwards.</p>

<p>But my remark wuz evidently a-hangin’ round in
some by-place in his mind, for he presently remarked
as he went down the path&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, as you say, the view is perfectly enchanting.”</p>

<p>And he gazed dreamily at the rocks that riz up
before us and shet out every mite of view from that
place.</p>

<p>Al Faizi stood on the lofty eminence a-lookin’
off in silence, and it seemed as though he couldn’t
hardly be tore from the seen; and the grandeur
and beauty wuz reflected in his eyes, some as you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>can see your own face in a pardner’s orbs if you
look clost and lovin’ into ’em.</p>

<p>Alice and Adrian wuz a-walkin’ along, and
seemed to be enjoyin’ themselves first-rate.</p>

<p>Adrian wuz a-askin’ her quite a number of
questions about Robert Bruce and King James,
etc., etc., and she wuz a-answerin’ him quite lusid;
bein’ so late at school made her quite a adept in
history, adepter than any of the rest of us wuz, by
fur.</p>

<p>Wall, we went to the Church of St. Giles, and
we see the Heart of Mid Lothian. I had heard
Thomas J. read the story, and I wuz interested in it.</p>

<p>In the northwest corner of the church there is
a heart cut in the pavement, and here the old
Tolbooth, the city prison, first stood. In St. Giles
Churchyard John Knox wuz buried.</p>

<p>The grave-stun has nothin’ but his initial and
the date of his death. As I looked at it, I
thought what long epitaphs&mdash;and in poetry, too,
some on ’em&mdash;failed to git any attention from
posterity. But as long as posterity lives&mdash;and I
spoze that will be a good while yet&mdash;this unasumin’
grave will be visited, for a Man lies buried
here&mdash;a hero who wuzn’t afraid to speak his mind,
and who follered the right, so fur as he see it,
through good and evil report.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>
<p>Wall, in the Parliament House we see a copy
of the first Bible that wuz ever printed. That
gin me a sight of emotions&mdash;a sight; and I had
quite a number of emotions a-seein’ the manuscript
of the Waverley Novels, and in meditatin’ that
Walter’s own hand rested on these pages.</p>

<p>Kinder tired hands some of the time, no doubt,
and the eyes above heavy from study and toil.
And he (Walter) not a-dreamin’ how so many years
after she who wuz once Smith would stand and
look on ’em with respect and almost veneration.</p>

<p>No; he didn’t have this to encourage him and
make him happy, poor creeter!</p>

<p>But how well he did; how much happiness he
has gin, and how much valuable information has
been took onbeknown from the pages of his stories,
like powders of smartweed in a spunful of honey.</p>

<p>Old Gray Friar’s Church and churchyard wuz
dretful interestin’ to us on account of a good many
things.</p>

<p>Alice and I wuz extremely interested to learn
that here wuz where Walter Scott ust to come to
meetin’ in his young days. And to see the graves
of his Pa and his Ma, and some of the rest of his
folks in the old churchyard.</p>

<p>In this meetin’-house the National Covenant wuz
signed in 1638. After listenin’ to a heart-searchin’ sermon
by Alexander Henderson this paper wuz signed
by the Earl of Sutherland, and all the rest of the folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
who wuz to meetin’ that day. It wuz then took out
into the buryin’-ground outside, and spread out on
a flat tombstone&mdash;a fittin’ spot, jedgin’ from what
come afterwards&mdash;and signed by crowds and crowds
of the people. Some writ their names in blood,
showin’ their willingness to die for the Faith.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>The National Covenant signed by the Earl of Sutherland.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This wuz the Confession of Faith of 1580, drawed
up by the principal Presbyterian ministers of Edinburgh.
Them that signed it agreed to protect and
preserve their religion even to the death.</p>

<p>And these Covenanters wuz persecuted and killed
for their faith, and then, when they wuz in power,
they wuz jest as cruel to their persecutors.</p>

<p>And all in the name of Religion. Sweet sperit,
how can she stand it? But I spoze she made allowances
for ’em, a-thinkin’ they wuz mistook.</p>

<p>Al Faizi looked down in silence on the stun with
a railin’ round it where the Covenant wuz written.
And finally he took out that book of hisen with a
cross on it, and he writ quite a lot in it. What it
wuz I d’no.</p>

<p>And as he stood in front of that monument, riz
up there to the memory of the martyrs put to death
for their religion, he writ a hull lot more.</p>

<p>I myself got a piece of paper from Josiah’s
account book, and I had a pencil with me, and I
copied this inscription, so’s to let Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> J. see it.</p>

<p>It wuz dretful readin’. As History held up her
torch to light me as I writ it down, mournin’ weeds
seemed to wrop her round and droop over her forward,
and her face looked cold and pale and awful
out from under them weeds. It read as follers&mdash;</p>

<p>And I thought, I can tell you, as I read it of
how Miss Argyll felt and Miss Renwick and the
children, for though it is a good ways back, it hurt
jest as bad to have your head cut off then as it duz
now, and hearts of loved ones who wuz left ached
jest as bad.</p>

<p>It read as follers&mdash;</p>

<p>“From May 27, 1661, that the most noble Marquise
of Argyll was beheaded, to the 17th of February,
1668, that Mr. James Renwick suffered, were
one way or other murdered or destroyed for the
same cause about 18,000, of whom were executed
in Edinburgh about 100 of noblemen, gentlemen,
ministers, and other noble martyrs for Jesus
Christ.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi’s face wuz a deep study as he stood
there.</p>

<p>And he sez to Martin, who had sauntered up and
wuz a-lookin’ round, with his hands in his pantaloons
pockets&mdash;</p>

<p>Sez Al Faizi&mdash;“This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> war was between Presbyterians
and Catholics?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Martin.</p>

<p>“Both of these religious sects thought they were
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Martin; “I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“They both send missionaries to my people?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Martin; “quite likely; of course they
do.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi didn’t say nothin’, but he writ down
quite a lot more; what it wuz I d’no.</p>

<p>But his face looked very thoughtful, and the
light struck that jewelled cross on the back of his
little book, and its rays streamed out as red as
blood.</p>

<p>But he kinder shifted it a little after awhile, and
a pure and lambient light gleamed from it.</p>

<p>Queer! I’d like to know what them stuns wuz.</p>

<p>I d’no what Josiah did think as he looked
at that monument, but I had a sight of emotions,
and of great size. And I sez to my pardner&mdash;</p>

<p>“One thing I am impressed by as I read of these
dretful things done by men who thought they wuz
doin’ right,” sez I, “it learns me to not be too set
in my own way, even when I think I am right.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “I always knew you wuz too sot!”</p>

<p>Somehow the words grated on my nerve. It is
so much easier to run yourself down than to be
run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>But right here in front of so many martyrs I
wuzn’t goin’ to be overcome by a muskeeter, for
truly my sufferin’s wuzn’t bigger than that, compared
to theirn.</p>

<p>And I wuz jest a-goin’ to complete my self-conquest
by speakin’ soft to him, when he whispered
to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m as hungry as a bear, Samantha. Not a
bear in a circus,” sez he, “but a Rocky Mountain
bear.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Martin hain’t about ready to go?”</p>

<p>Wall, Martin wuz ready by that time; but I see
lots of other things whilst we wuz there. Alice
and Martin went to the Queen’s Drive. I d’no
who the Queen wuz, nor who she driv, nor
how fur.</p>

<p>And they went to the ruins of St. Anthony’s
Chapel, and Alice raved over the beautiful view
from Arthur’s Seat. I d’no what kind of a
seat it wuz, nor how long Arthur sot in it, but she
said that the view from there wuz enchantin’. And
we all went to the Antiquarian Museum, and see
sights and sights of relicks. Autograph letters from
Charles 2nd, Cromwell, Mary, Queen of Scots, and
we see the old Scotch Covenant with the names of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>Montrose, Lothair, etc., signed to it. And one
of the banners them Covenanters had bore in their
battles.</p>

<p>Here wuz the very glass that Prince Charlie
drank from before the battle of Culloden. And
then the pulpit of John Knox; out of which that
man three hundred years
ago thundered out sech
burnin’ words agin the
Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Here is a piece of the
last garments put on to
Robert Bruce, and in
which he was laid in his
last sleep&mdash;a sound sleep.
Poor creeter! disturbed
not by the warlike bugles
and sounds of fray.</p>

<p>And here is the blue
ribbin of the Knight of
the Garter, wore by
Prince Charlie, and the ring gin to him by Flora
Macdonald as they parted.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_259.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>When Prince Charlie and Flora Macdonald parted.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And then there wuz sights and sights of weepons,
coins, medallions, seals, old implements, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But one thing I see there madded me more’n
considerable; it wuz a kind of a gullotine rigged up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>with a axe, that wuz held up between two posts, and
let down on the necks of ’em they wanted to kill.
This very thing took the life of the Earl of Argyll,
Sir John Gordon, and lots of others.</p>

<p>But what madded me most wuz the name of the
creeter.</p>

<p>“The Maiden.”</p>

<p>It is a wonder they didn’t call it the “Old
Maiden,” if they’d wanted to be a little meaner.</p>

<p>It rousted me up fearfully to think a lot of men
should rig up such a horrid, death-dealin’ thing to
carry out their bloody and brutal idees and then
call it&mdash;“Maiden.”</p>

<p>Why didn’t they call it after their own selves,
and call it&mdash;the “Old Man,” or “the Feller,” or
sunthin’ like that?</p>

<p>“The Maiden!!!”</p>

<p>No woman would countenance sech cuttin’ off
the heads of folks, and they knew it. They named
it so to be mean.</p>

<p>And Martin, sayin’ that it would be expected of
him, and he should have questions asked him by
influential parties which he should want to answer,
went to see lots of Horsepitals, and Schools, and
Universities.</p>

<p>Josiah went with him one day, and come home
and said Heriot’s Horsepital beat anything he ever
see for architecture, and, sez he, “it wuz designed
by Indigo Jones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, “I don’t believe any woman ever named
her babe ‘Indigo’ in this world.” And I inquired,
and found out that it wuz “Inigo.”</p>

<p>Josiah said I hadn’t made out much. It wuzn’t
any better name. But it wuz.</p>

<p>Indigo! the idee!!</p>

<p>A little ways out of the town is the home where
Doctor Guthrie lived, and one of the most beautiful
and interestin’ houses I see in Scotland or anywhere
else. It wuz the one his brother, Mr. Thomas
Nelson, built. Every American who goes to Scotland
ort to walk by it and meditate out a spell, anyway,
if they don’t go in.</p>

<p>Durin’ our late war, when foreign nations thought
our great republic wuz a-totterin’ over to ruin, this
man had faith in us, and invested thousands of
pounds in goverment bonds.</p>

<p>And the rise in them bonds paid every cent this
palace of hisen cost. I didn’t begrech it to him,
not at all.</p>

<p>Them in England who invested so largely in
Confederate bonds, and lost every cent, wouldn’t
be so happy in ridin’ by that noble structure and
lookin’ at it, mebby.</p>

<p class="h2sub">MEMORIES OF SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>

<p>And one excursion I took part in with the
greatest delight and one small satchel&mdash;for we wuz
to stay one night&mdash;wuz to Melrose Abbey and Abbotsford,
the home of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<div class="figright illowp53" id="i_263" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_263.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“I could sing to you,”
sez he.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Josiah said he wanted to see Melrose Abbey by
moonlight. He said it would be so romantic, and,
sez he, “I wish I could have a guitar. How stylish
and romantic it would be for you and me, Samantha,
to visit it by moonlight, and I could sing to
you,” sez he.</p>

<p>But I sez, “A old couple a-viewin’ that seen by
moonlight, with thick blanket shawls on, and
heavy overshues&mdash;and I should wear ’em, Josiah,”
sez I, “and make you wear ’em, for our rumatizes
is bad, and lookin’ up at the moon through
spectacles hain’t what it would be in younger and
less bundled-up days.”</p>

<p>“Throw a blanket onto it!” sez he; “wet a
blanket wet as sop, and throw it onto my plan.
I never can git you to foller up any idees of mine
that are stylish and romantic.”</p>

<p>“I’ll foller ’em,” sez I, “but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>I’ve got to foller
’em with an eye on azmy and rumatiz. And as
for your singin’,” sez I, “it don’t seem as if I can
bear it.” And I shuddered imperceptibly; I
thought of the near past.</p>

<p>But the rubber strings that men’s memories and
consciences are strung on a good deal of the
time had sprung back, and he wuz jest
as ready to be sentimental and bust out
in song as if he hadn’t been took for a
Banshee.</p>

<p>But we visited the Abbey in broad
daylight, which wuz better for our two
healths at our age. We went to the
Abbey Hotel, close by the Abbey, and
after a comfortable dinner we went
through the little iron gate that leads
into the grand and wonderful ruin.</p>

<p>It must have been a sight, a sight, in
its early days. But bein’ built in the first place in
1136, it hadn’t ort to be expected to be in the order
it would have been if it had been built in 1836,
and we’d call that bein’ pretty old in our young
country.</p>

<p>Wall, we walked all round amongst the ruins,
and the waves of the past swashed up aginst me in
a powerful manner.</p>

<p>Here, sez I to myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> is the place where the
heart of Robert Bruce is buried. That eager, restless
heart that dared so much, and endured so
much. Strange, passing strange that that great
heart lays dumb and mute, and Samantha Allen
and her pardner are a-walkin’ over it.</p>

<p>Here is the grave of the wizard that bold Deloraine
visited, as I told Josiah, and he looked down
with scornful mean, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“He has stopped his wizardin’ now!”</p>

<p>Josiah has no veneration for the occult.</p>

<p>And here lies the Earl of Douglas, and here is
the tomb of King Alexander 2nd.</p>

<p>Hero, king, and wizard, all dust, and through
the tall, ruined arches the blue sky smiles down on
all on ’em alike, and sweet Nater drops on their
restin’-places; on grave and monuments the same
posies, and flowers, and long sprays of ivy.</p>

<p>Nater is the true democrat; she treats all alike.</p>

<p>But what richness of carvin’ and design is to be
seen on every side; every ornament that wuz ever
carved, it seems to me, wuz here on the tall pillows
and arches. And that east winder&mdash;wall, I wake
up in the night now, and think on’t, the perfect
wonder and symetry of its design, and the marvels
of its stun sculptur.</p>

<p>But how different folks look at things! Al
Faizi, as he looked up and around him, took in
the beauty and majesty of the seen in every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
pore,
as you may say&mdash;you could see that in his liniment.</p>

<p>Alice wuz took up with some of the marvellous
statutes and sculpturs of wreath and blossom. And
Adrian wuz a-pickin’ some flowers. It beat all
what a case that child wuz for flowers. And Josiah
wuz took up, I guess, with musin’ on the failure of
his romantic idees, as he sauntered about. But
Martin, when he’d been there about an hour, he
come up to me, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, having seen everything there is to see
here, I think we had better go. I expect some
letters and telegrams,” sez he, “and I’ve seen sufficient
to reply to any inquiries that could be made
of me at home.”</p>

<p>Everything we could see! Why, I could have
hung right round there for a week and discovered
some new wonder and beauty every hour.</p>

<p>But it wuz compromised in this way: Martin
went back to the hotel, and Josiah and Adrian went
with him. And Al Faizi and Alice and I stayed
till night wuz a-drawin’ down her mantilly previous
to puttin’ it on.</p>

<p>The soft linin’ on’t of crimson and gold wuz
turned over in the west as we walked back to the
little hotel.</p>

<p>Wall, the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span> mornin’, bright and early, Martin
got a carriage, and we drove three miles to Abbotsford,
the home of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>By Martin’s advice (that man has good practical
idees) we took our waterproofs and umbrells. And
glad enough wuz we that we did; why, in all our
trips almost waterproofs wuz neccessary companions;
for short, quick showers would descend upon
us at any time seemin’ly, and then pass away jest as
quick.</p>

<p>Three showers come up that very day, but two
on ’em took place when we wuz inside, and the
third jest before we got home at night, so umbrells
and waterproofs saved us from damage.</p>

<p>Wall, we found it wuz a beautiful place, castle
and mansion, about half and half. It stands in
well-kep’, handsome grounds and sets down in a
sort of a valley amongst the hills which stands round
it, as if proud on’t and glad to shelter and protect it
all they could.</p>

<p>Home of industrious talent, so hard-workin’ and
constant as to be as good if not better than
genius.</p>

<p>The mansion and all round it is full of relicks of
the past.</p>

<p>The big entrance hall is panelled with dark wood,
and all along the cornice the different Coats of
Arms of the Border is painted in rich colors and
shields, on which is this inscription&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“These be the coat armories of the clans and
chief men of name wha keepit the marchys of Scotland
in the auld tyme for the kynge. True men
were they, in their defence. God them defendyt.”</p>

<p>Here you see battle-axes and breastplates and
weepons of all kinds. Most all on ’em with a
tragic history. Here wuz several suits of armor:
one on ’em holdin’ a big sword in its hand, captured
at Bosworth’s Field. Another holds a immense
claymore took from the battlefield of Culloden.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz took up with the looks of that, and
he said he wished he owned one, and, sez he, “how
nice it would be if I only had a coat of armor!</p>

<p>“Why, Samantha,” sez he, “how economical!
When a man got one suit, he never would have to
be measured for another suit of clothes&mdash;never be
cheated by tailors or pinched by ’em. Cool in the
summer,” sez he&mdash;“how cool and good they would
feel in dog-days, when broadcloth jest clings to you;
and warm in winter. The cold wind couldn’t blow
through them collars,” sez he, alludin’ to the helmets.</p>

<p>“And then,” sez he, “when your clothes got
dirty, jest wet a towel and clean ’em off&mdash;you could
do it in half an hour, and then they’d be good for another
twenty years. I wonder,” sez he, “if I could
dicker with the Widder Scott for one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
suits? Scott’ll never wear ’em agin,” sez he.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp59" id="i_268" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_268.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“When they got dirty, jest wet a towel and clean ’em off.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>But I hastened to set him right, and, sez I, “Scott
never wore one of ’em. He knew too much. How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>do you spoze,” sez I, “you could git round and do
your spring’s work a-luggin’ round a ton of old
iron?” Sez I, “You couldn’t lift one of the legs
on’t with both your hands, and how could you
plough with one on ’em on?”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah dreamily&mdash;he wuzn’t hearin’ a word I
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“If I could git it cheaper without that head-piece,
I might use our coal scuttle.” Sez he, “I believe
its shape is more stylish. Oh!” sez he, “what
a excitement I would make a-walkin’ into the
Jonesville meetin’-house with the hull thing on!
how stylish and uneek it would be!</p>

<p>“Where is the Widder Scott?” sez he; “I’ll
tackle her about it.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “She’s with her noble husband in a land
where style and folly have no home.”</p>

<p>And then with deep argument I made him see
that a suit of armor was not suitable for farm work
or meetin’-house duties.</p>

<p>But he gin it up reluctant, and at the last he sez&mdash;“How
it would clank and rattle as I passed round
the contribution plate&mdash;how all the other deacons
would open their eyes!”</p>

<p>But I silently led him away to where there wuz a
suit of Scott’s clothes, the last ones he wore.</p>

<p>And I had a very large variety of emotions as I
looked on the clothes that had wropped round the
magician who had the power to charm the hull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
world with his magic pen. My emotions drownded
out the talk of the guide and the remarks of Martin
and Josiah. And on one side of the fireplace
stood the famous mistletoe trunk, as it’s called,
that poor Genevra hid herself in on her weddin’
night. The Baron’s daughter, you know, the one
that her Pa called “The star of that goodly company,”
meanin’, I spoze, that she looked better
than any of the rest of the young folks that he’d
invited in to the weddin’. Poor, pretty, young
creeter! I wuz always dretful sorry for her.</p>

<p>You know what she said to Lovell, the young
feller she wuz married to (he worshipped the very
ground she walked on).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am weary of dancing now, she cried;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The clue to my secret hiding-place.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And you probble remember how the crazed
young bridegroom, and the old Baron, and all the
rest of the weddin’ guests hunted for the pretty,
young creeter all night and all day, and for weeks
and months and years&mdash;all in vain, in vain.</p>

<p>Till at last, when Lovell (poor, broken-hearted
creeter!) wuz a old white-headed man, a old chest
wuz found in the castle, and they see, on liftin’ up
the led&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>But I don’t have any idee that it wuz the mistletoe
that caused the trouble. I spoze that it would
have been jest the same if it had been red cedar
hung up there, or dog-wood.</p>

<p>It wuz more likely a lack of common sense and
lookin’ ahead. Genevra ort to tried the lock and
see how tight the led shet down, and had a little
forethought afore she got into it.</p>

<p>But poor, young creeter! I don’t spoze she
thought of anything, only jest her light-hearted happiness
and gayety, and wuz carried away by the

<p>Poor, pretty young thing, how she must have felt

<p>Oh, dear me! I wiped my eyes as this heart-searchin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>

my Tirzah Ann. And I couldn’t help thinkin’ that
it would be jest like Tirzah to be ketched in that way.
Maggie, my son’s wife, would have looked at the
ketch before she let the led down, and she’d never
wrinkled up a long white dress in that contracted place.</p>

<p>But I am indeed a-eppisodin’ and to resoom.</p>

<p>The entrance hall and the rooms leadin’ out of it
are jest as Mr. Scott left ’em, and that made me
feel curous as a dog to look round me, and I
meditated and eppisoded to extreme lengths, to
myself mostly.</p>

<p>The library is a large and handsome room, lined
with books, twenty thousand in all. And underneath
its deep, big winders runs the river Tweed.</p>

<p>How many times, when he got tired of writin’
down his rushin’ thoughts, did Walter stand and
lean up aginst the winder, and look down into the
rushin’ river!</p>

<p>I leaned up aginst the side of the winder where
he had leaned, and on lookin’ down, I see that the
river wuz still a-flowin’ along jest the same. But
the eager, active mind wuz&mdash;where?</p>

<p>The dead water, with no soul, rushed and flowed
on; the rocks couldn’t stop it&mdash;no, it made a leap
downward and flowed on more free and placider.</p>

<p>And I sez to myself&mdash;“Death’s rocky portals is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
jest the same; after the leap down into the oncertainty&mdash;the
darkness, it goes on in the Certainty
and the Light, fuller and freer than ever.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything of these thoughts to my
pardner. He wuz a-lookin’ round at one thing and
another, and not havin’ the deep feelin’s that I had,
as I could see.</p>

<p>But Al Faizi wuz a-lookin’ down into the water
or at the beautiful landscape from another winder.
And I’ll bet if I’d atted him about it his idees would
have been congenial to mine and inspirin’. I jedged
so from the looks of his liniment.</p>

<p>But I knew he didn’t care about talkin’ much, so
I restrained my tongue.</p>

<p>The rest on ’em wuz a-prowlin’ round and
a-lookin’ at relicks&mdash;priceless ones, some on ’em&mdash;and
I methought to myself volumes as I looked on ’em.</p>

<p>The clock of Marie Antoinette wuz there&mdash;what
hours, what hours that clock ticked off for Marie!</p>

<p>And then there wuz the inkstand of Lord Byron&mdash;and
what black, gloomy ink and sometimes
kinder nasty, that poor creeter dipped his pen in a
good deal of the time&mdash;but lofty and riz up, too, at
times, very.</p>

<p>And then there wuz two gold bees took from
Napoleon’s carriage&mdash;what bees buzzed and hummed
in his ambitious brain as the carriage whirled him
on! Then there wuz a crucifix that belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
Mary, Queen of Scots; most probble held clost
to her poor, frightened heart as the pretty creeter
walked away to have her head cut off.</p>

<p>A miniature portrait of Prince Charlie, a box
from Miss Edgeworth, a purse made by Joanna
Baillie, a little case from Miss Martineau, a snuff-box
of George IV., and lots, and lots, and lots of
relicks from Egypt and Italy and everywhere else.
But I d’no as I see any from Jonesville. But
oversights will take place, and <i>contrarytemps</i> will
occur.</p>

<p>Wall, in the armory we see bows, and arrers, and
spears, and muskets, and rifles. A musket that belonged
to Rob Roy, a sword gin by Charles 1st to
the Marquis of Montrose, a pair of pistols that belonged
to the 1st Napoleon, found after the battle
of Waterloo. Poor creeter, how he must have felt!
No wonder he lost ’em! James VI. hunting flask,
the key of old Tolbooth prison. And then we see
thumb-screws, and a gag for scoldin’ wives&mdash;I looked
on that with scorn.</p>

<p>But Josiah jest peered and squinted at it, and
walked all round it, and took out a piece of string
out of his pocket and tried to measure it, and
I sez, “What on earth are you a-doin’?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>believe I could make one
of ’em after I got home, with a little of Ury’s
help.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of one, Josiah Allen?” sez I
coldly.</p>

</div>

<p>“Oh, nothin’, nothin’ in the world, only I thought
it would be uneek to own one. I never should
think of usin’ it,” sez he, as I looked still more
stonily at him.</p>

<p>“I should think not!” sez I, and my axents wuz
about the temperture of five ice suckles.</p>

<p>But after we’d all turned away and wuz a-lookin’
at other relicks, I see him furtively apply that string
to it, and mark down the dimensions on’t in his account
book.</p>

<p>I d’no what under the sun the man wuz a-thinkin’
on, and I don’t believe he did.</p>

<p>Wall, we wandered round through the rooms for
a long time, I with memories a-walkin’ tight to my
side&mdash;what a host of ’em wuz a-follerin’ me of them
shadow shapes&mdash;</p>

<p>Sweet Ellen Douglas, and Ivanhoe, and Rebecca,
Marmion, Rob Roy, Guy Mannering, Rosamond,
Nigel, the Wild Huntsman, Meg Merrilies, etc.,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Oh, what a crowd of phantoms, and what different
lookin’ creeters they wuz that wuz a-walkin’ up
and down that room with me, onbeknown to Josiah
and the rest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>And what curous words they wuz a-pourin’ out
into my ears&mdash;words that I only could hear&mdash;some
on ’em wuz in poetry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Charge, Chester, charge&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On, Stanley, on”&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>or&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Without my lover, what is Heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And with him, what were Hell?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And noble, practical idees, and solemn, historical
ones wuz a-soundin’ in my ears. And figgers of
noble knights and heroes and fair ladies wuz by
my side, up and down the room they walked with
me and in and out.</p>

<p>Some of the picters on the walls of the different
rooms wuz dretful interestin’&mdash;dretful. The one on
’em that gin my heart and mind the deepest shock
wuz the head of poor Mary, Queen of Scots, said
to have been took a few hours after her execution.
The mournful, noble beauty of that white, still face
gin me feelin’s I couldn’t express, and I didn’t
try to.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the home where her soul had so
lately sojourned had a dignity and peace gin it,
a-flowin’ out from the seens that soul wuz a-beholdin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
after it had cast off the tribulations and persecutions
of earth.</p>

<p>It wuz a dretful interestin’ picter to me.</p>

<p>Then there wuz Charles XII. of Sweden, Charles
II. and Cromwell, and lots of picters by Turner
and other great artists.</p>

<p>The house from top to bottom wuz full to over-flowin’
with objects of interest. I could have stayed
there for days and not seen half, but Time and
Martin wuz a-hastenin’.</p>

<p>And we went from there to Dryburgh Abbey, to
see the spot where Scott wuz buried.</p>

<p>We see his tomb and the place where his ancestors
are buried. His son-in-law, Mr. Lockhart, who
wrote Scott’s biography, is buried here.</p>

<p>In Dryburgh Abbey we see the winder where the
White Maid of Avenal ust to appear.</p>

<p>But she didn’t appear to us, much as I’d loved to
seen her (right there in broad daylight, with my
pardner with me).</p>

<p>The Abbey is said to be hanted, mebby by them
who have been imprisoned and tortured in the
dungeons onderneath.</p>

<p>There are holes in the walls where the hands of
prisoners were held by heavy wedges.</p>

<p>It don’t seem right to have a meetin’-house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> used
to torture folks in, and so I told Josiah.</p>

<p>But he said that he didn’t know about it; he
thought once in awhile it would do good to jest
pinch Deacon Garvin’s thumb a little, to make him
do right, or to make Deacon Bobbett come to terms,
when he got too rambunktious to business meetin’s
and wanted his own way.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “or to make Deacon Josiah Allen
more willin’ to give to charitable objects.”</p>

<p>His liniment fell.</p>

<p>“Oh, the Charitable Object has more done for
him than I do, they’re always raisin’ money for
him.”</p>

<p>That wuz his favorite mode of puttin’ off from
givin’ to charity.</p>

<p>“And,” sez I, “you see from Loyola and Cromwell
down to Josiah Allen the carnal mind wants
to punish somebody else for doin’ suthin’ different
from what you want ’em to do.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I wonder if Martin hain’t a-goin’
back? I believe it’s a-goin’ to rain, and you ort to
have sunthin’ to eat, Samantha. It worries me to
have you see so much on an empty stumick.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, for his thoughtfulness touched me,
“some dinner would taste good.”</p>

<p>Sez he, in a low, thrillin’ voice&mdash;“Samantha,” and
tears wuz almost in his eyes as he spoke, “imagine
I am in the barn door, and the smell of roast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
chicken, and baked potatoes, and lemon puddin’,
and cream biscuit floats out, a-wroppin’ you all
round, as you are a-standin’ in the back door a-callin’
me in to dinner. As you stand there a-lookin’
perfectly beautiful,” sez he.</p>

<p>Agin my heart wuz touched, and sez I, “And
roses under the winders, and voyalets, and the
blossomin’ trees, and the new-mown grass in the
orchard a-smellin’ sweet as the scent comes in on
the warm south breeze.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “and the good, rich coffee, and
cream cheese, and honey, and things.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “and after dinner we could set
down, and set there as long as we wanted to.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stir in over three days!” sez he,
“not an inch from my good old rockin’-chair.</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, with a deep sithe, “them days wuz
too happy to last.”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “Providence permittin’, we will see
agin the cliffs of Jonesville; and home never seemed
so sweet as it will when troubles and toil and
foreign travel is all past, and our two barks are
moored once more in our own peaceful door-yard.”</p>

<p>“Never to be <i>on</i>moored!” sez he, with a almost
fierce mean. And my own longin’ heart and achin’
back and tired-out eyeballs gin a deep assent to
his remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>Sweet, sweet is the fruits of foreign travel, but
lofty and precipitus are the thorny branches it hangs
on, and wearin’ in the extreme is the job of pickin’
’em offen foreign fields and bringin’ ’em home in
our mind basket.</p>

<p>And happy are they who carry ’em back fresh
and hull and sound&mdash;some folks carry ’em home in
a sort of a jell or a jam&mdash;dretful mixed up and promiscus
like.</p>

<p>Wall, as we got back to Edinburgh it was on the
first edge of the evenin’, and I had the chance of
hearin’ a real Scotch ministrel; not one
of them bagpipes of theirn, which sounds
perfectly awful to me, but which Josiah
wuz dretful took with (of which more
anon), but this man had a violin, or fiddle,
and sung in a sweet, high voice some
of the best ballads of the country.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Josiah wuz dretful

</div>

<p>I shed tears and wept to hear some on
’em.</p>

<p>“Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled.”</p>

<p>And “Auld Joe Nickleson’s Bonnie
Nannie.”</p>

<p>My heart sort o’ listened as I hearn the
words. I had hearn our Tirzah Ann sing
’em in the melancholy stillness of a June
evenin’, when through the open winder the
distant sounds of the frogs and the tree-tuds would
come in from the cedar swamp, fur off, and the
moonlight throw all over her and the organ the
long shadders of the mornin’-glories.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>
<p>This is one of the verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“There is mony a joy in this world below,</div>

<p>There wuzn’t hardly a dry eye in my head as I heard
it, and I looked round to see how my Josiah wuz
a-takin’ it.</p>

<p>But right behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span> that sweet singer wuz a man
with a bagpipe, and after the melodious warbler had
moved away he piped up, right under our winder,
that screechin’, awful sound; and Josiah’s attention
wuz all took up with him.</p>

<p>And there wuz a distant, dreamy look to my
pardner’s eyes as he gazed onto him, of which I did
not git the full meanin’ till bime-by&mdash;of which more
anon.</p>

<p>After we had had our supper and had gone to
our room Adrian come a-runnin’ in and told us that
a company of Scotch soldiers wuz marchin’ through
the place on their way to Sterling.</p>

<p>So we quickly made our way out onto a balcony,
where we could git a good view of ’em, with their
short kilt skirts, bare legs, plaid stockin’s, and
feathers. If it hadn’t been for their whiskers and
mustaches, you’d most thought they wuz wimmen.</p>

<p>Sez Alice, “Oh, how picturesque they look!
don’t they?”</p>

<p>And I sez, “More picturesque than comfortable!”
Sez I, “What clothes them must be to wear
into a battle-field, or to pick rosberrys in! What
would hender thorns and bullets from stickin’ right
into them bare legs?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “They don’t use no reason; we see to-day
that they ust to dress in iron all over, when they
ust to go into battle, but now they go half
naked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Sez I, “Oh, the beauty of megumness! They
wore too much in old times, and now not enough,
which, I’ll bet, their cold legs would testify to, if
they could speak up.”</p>

<p>As I said of the bagpipes&mdash;but more anon.</p>

<p>It wuz that night, jest as I wuz preparin’ my
body for rest, that Josiah’s dreamy study a-lookin’
at the bagpipes become manifest. I see my companion
foldin’ up two handkerchiefs kinder queer
and a-measurin’ ’em by his arm, and anon kinder
layin’ his jack-knife between ’em, and actin’.</p>

<p>And I sez, “What are you a-doin’, Josiah
Allen?”</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “I wuz a-thinkin’ of makin’ a
bagpipe.”</p>

<p>“Out of two handkerchiefs!” sez I mockin’ly.</p>

<p>“No; I wuz jest a-layin’ out the work and gittin’
a view of its nater;” sez he, “I wuz a-layin’ out to
use two bags.”</p>

<p>“Bags?” sez I.</p>

<p>“Yes, meal bags,” sez he; “take them bags, and
dip ’em into starch to stiffen ’em, and then paint
and varnish ’em, and there you are as fur as the
wind is concerned; the music,” sez he, “I believe
could be rigged up some way with a mouth-organ
or sunthin’, or mebbe our old accordeun; fix the
bags onto both ends on’t and then draw ’em out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
or shet ’em up, with wind accordin’.</p>

<p>“What a sensation it would create in Jonesville!
How it would stir the people up!” sez he.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">What a sensation it would

</div>

<p>“And I might on occasions, on 4th of July and
sech, wear the Tarten costume. I
could take that old plaid overskirt of
yours, Samantha, it’s dressy, you
know&mdash;red and green&mdash;cut it off a
little above my knees, and my own
red stockin’s would look all right.
And the old rooster would furnish
very stylish feathers&mdash;I should look
beautiful! And of course,” sez he,
“I should sing with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “your rumatic old
knees would look beautiful bare naked,
and them bags and accordeun,
and your singin’ would empty Jonesville
as soon as a cyclone would, or a
water-spout.” And, in the name of duty, I said
further, “Your singin’ is like thumb-screws and
gullotines, and with that bagpipe added, it would
cry to Heaven!”</p>

<p>“There it is! there it is!” sez he! “throw cold
water on it.”</p>

<p>“Better that,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> sez I, “than the hot water you
would be deluged with if you should try it in
public. Nobody would stand it, and you’d find it
out they wouldn’t without scaldin’ you.”</p>

<p>Wall, from Edinburgh Martin said that we would
start for London, and so we took the train goin’
south and sot off in the early mornin’ and in pretty
good sperits.</p>

<p>We only made one stop on our way to London,
and that wuz at York&mdash;the quaint, old, walled
city, in which Americans take an interest on account
of their own New York bein’ named after it.</p>

<p>Our New York is some younger&mdash;about seventeen
hundred years younger, and that is a good deal
of difference between a Ma and a young child. But,
then, it hain’t common to have the youngster about
twenty times bigger than its Ma.</p>

<p>Wall, we went to a good tarvern and recooperated
a little durin’ the night from the fatigues of travel,
and the next mornin’ bright and early we sot out
to see the sights of the city, knowin’ that our stay
there wuz to be but short.</p>

<p>Martin engaged a guide, though he didn’t often
want one, sayin’, as he did, that he felt that he wuz
so familar with history and all those places that a
guide was “an unnecessary outlay and a drug.”</p>

<p>But bein’ in a hurry to git on to-day, we went first
to see the great wall that has stood for centuries, and
seems able to stand quite a number more of ’em. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
got out of the carriage and laid my hand on the
wall, feelin’ that it would be a satisfaction to put my
hand on the stun.</p>

<p>Josiah said, “That looks foolish, Samantha; you
have never tried once to put your hand on to
the stun wall between our paster and Deacon
Gowdy’s.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, “that wall has never been looked
upon by Adrian and Constantine the Great; it
has never been trod by Britons, Picts, Danes, and
Saxons, each on ’em a-warrin’ for and defendin’ their
native land.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “our wall is a crackin’ good one.”
Josiah looked kinder scorfin’ at me for my enthoosiasm,
but I didn’t mind it any.</p>

<p>And Martin, seein’ my enthoosiasm, and though he
didn’t share it, not at all, he asked me if I didn’t want
to go up and walk on the great wall&mdash;which I did.
So we had the carriage stopped at one of the gates,
and he and I and Alice and Al Faizi went up and
walked on the parapets.</p>

<p>And I probble had as many as 70 or 80 emotions
as I felt that eight-foot wall under my feet and
looked up at the solid, round watch-towers, with
narrer slits in the stun, for arrers to be shot out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>onto the enemies, and way up above ’em the little
turrets for the sentinuls to look out.</p>

<p>I wonder how that sentinul felt there on cool
moonlight nights twelve or fourteen hundred years
ago&mdash;I wonder what century old grief or pain hanted
his lonely heart through the night-watches&mdash;Love,
Hope, mebby they lightened his lonely watch jest
as they do in 1900.</p>

<p>Tenny rate, the same sun and moon looked down
on him, and Love and Hope is as old as they be&mdash;as
old as the world.</p>

<p>Al Faizi, I believe, had a sight of emotions, too.
He stood still and looked off with a dreamy look
on his face.</p>

<p>Martin thought the stun wuz good and solid,
and might be utilized for buildin’ depots and
grain elevators and sech.</p>

<p>Alice looked good-natered and didn’t say much.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz a-makin’ a cat’s cradle with Adrian
when we went back to the buggy. And I told him
I didn’t see how he could be a-playin’ with weltin’
cord at sech a time as this, when he could see this
wall.</p>

<p>And he sez, “Dum it all! mebby you wouldn’t
take so to stun walls if you had broke your back,
and got so many stun bruises as I have a-layin’
’em.”</p>

<p>“Wall,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span> sez I soothin’ly, “do jest as you feel, Josiah.
But I wouldn’t have missed the sight for a
dollar bill.”</p>

<p>Yes, it rousted up sights of emotions in me.</p>

<p>Another thing that endeared York to me: here
in this city wuz Christmas celebrated
for the first time by King Arthur,
fourteen hundred years ago.</p>

<p>I don’t spoze he ever gin a thought
at that time of what a train of turkeys,
Christmas presents, trees, plum
puddin’s, bells, stockin’s, Santa
Clauses, etc., etc., etc., would foller
on his wake. But it wuz a good
idee, and he wuz quite a likely creeter&mdash;buildin’
up the meetin’-housen the
Saxons had destroyed.</p>

<p>Wall, we thought we would leave
the Cathedral, or Minster, as they
call it for the last. And anon we
see a almost endless procession of
anteek gate-ways, and housen, museums, churches,
the ruined cloisters of St. Leonard founded by
Athelstane the Saxon, and the ruins of St. Mary’s
Abbey, with its old Norman arch and shattered
walls.</p>

<p>But from most every part of the city where we
might be we could see the Cathedral towerin’ up
above us, some like a mountain of sculptured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>turrets
and towers. And anon we found ourselves within
its walls, and its magnificent and grand beauty almost
struck us dumb with or.</p>

<p>The guide said that it wuz the most gorgeous and
beautiful in the world. But I considered it safe to
add a word to his description, which made it <i>one</i> of
the most gorgeous and magnificent cathedrals in
the world&mdash;and that I spoze is true.</p>

<p>It wuz about two hundred years a-buildin’, and I
don’t believe there is a carpenter in Jonesville that
could have done it a day sooner. Seth Widrick is
a swift worker on housen, but I believe Seth would
have been a week or two over that time at the
job.</p>

<p>The guide said that it wuz 500 and 24 feet long,
and 250 feet broad&mdash;24 feet longer than St. Paul’s
Cathedral in London, and 145 feet longer than
Westminster Abbey, and the most magnificent minster
in the world. The greatest beauty of the hull
interior is, I spoze, the immense east winder. Imagine
a great arched winder 75 feet high and 30 feet
broad all aglow and ablaze with the most magnificent
stained-glass. A multitude of saints, angels,
priests, etc., all wrought in glass, the colors of
which are so soft and glowin’, so harmonious, that
they can’t be reproduced in this day by the most
cunnin’ workmen; the secret is lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>This winder is known as The Five Sisters; the
pattern bein’ took, it is said, from embroideries
these maiden wimmen made.</p>

<p>Josiah said, when the guide mentioned it, “Good
for the old maids! they done well.”</p>

<p>But as I looked upon that marvellous poem of
glowin’ color, I felt beyend words, but I could still
think. And I thought proudly of the exquisite
work my sect had wrought, and I wuz glad for the
moment that I too wuz a woman; and though seven
hundred years lay between them noble sisters and
myself, yet I felt that our hearts, our souls, touched
each other in that pleasant day of 1895.</p>

<p>Wall, Passin’ Time and Josiah tore me away
from the contemplation of that glory, that wonder,
that delight&mdash;unequalled, I believe, in the hull
world.</p>

<p>And at Martin’s request, for he said that he should
be asked about it probble, and would wish to be
prepared with answers, we went out on a little stun
platform or bridge outside, from which we had a
view of the hull glowin’ interior&mdash;a vista of leafy
gothic arches, and sculptered columns, more’n
five hundred feet in length, and at the end the great
west winder, with the figgers of the eight earliest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>Archbishops of York, and to keep ’em company,
eight saints and other figgers.</p>

<p>All seemin’ly a-standin’ in the glowin’ light took
from the most gorgeous western sunset. They wuz
put up about five hundred years ago, and I can’t
begin to describe the beauty and richness of colorin’,
and design, nor Josiah can’t.</p>

<p>There wuz lots of other winders, too, that would
be remarkable anywhere else. And among ’em wuz
one over the entrance that they called the Marygold
winder, circles of small arches in the form of a
wheel, the color of which makes it look some like
that flower.</p>

<p>Though, as Josiah well said&mdash;“Nobody ever hearn
before of a marygool thirty feet acrost.”</p>

<p>In the vestries we see some historical relicks. One
of the oldest is the great Saxon Drinkin’ Horn, by
which the church holds valuable estate near
York.</p>

<p>The old chieftain, Ulphus, knelt at the altar and
drinked out of the horn, and by this act gave to
the church all his land, housen, etc., etc., givin’ to
the fathers this horn as a title-deed.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz dretful took up with it, and vowed
that he would save the horns from the next beef
creeter he killed and make out his next deed with it.</p>

<p>“So strong and safe,” sez he; “no ‘whereasis’ and
‘to wits’ and ‘namelys,’ and runnin’ up to a stake,
and back agin, to wit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Sez he, “It would be a boon to git rid of all that
nonsense. That would use up one horn, and then
I might make my will with the other. I could will
you all my property with it, Samantha, and then we
could both drink root-beer, or sunthin’, and you
could jest keep the horn, and there would be no
way to break the will. 2d. Wives have lots of
trouble, but how could anybody break it, Samantha,
when you had the horn locked up in the tin chest?”</p>

<p>It wuz thoughtful in him, and showed a deep
kindness to me, but I felt dubersome about it.</p>

<p>Then there wuz another drinkin’ cup presented
by Archbishop Scrope. But it wuz bigger than I
love to see&mdash;I am afraid that Mr. Scrope drinked
too much. But as he had his head cut off in 1405,
I couldn’t labor with him about it.</p>

<p>Then there wuz the chair in which the Saxon
kings wuz crowned. And a old Bible presented
by King Charles II., and one gin by Charles 1st.
A old communion plate 500 years old and oak
chests, etc., etc., etc.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">With the ends of the
fingers a-hangin’
down.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>When we looked at the communion plate Josiah
nudged me, and sez he, “Don’t that make you think
of she that wuz Sally Ann Plenty?” Sez he, “You
know she bought a old communion service once
because she could git it for a little or nothin’.” Sez
he, “That wuz the same day that she bought a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
crosscut saw, and a box of gloves 4 sizes too big
for her, and wore ’em with the ends of the fingers
a-hangin’ down, jest as if they wuz onjointed.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Hush! This is no place to bring up sech
worldly and foolish eppisodes.”</p>

<p>Wall, Martin clim up into the Lantern
Tower, two hundred and thirteen feet
high, for he said that he would wish to
say that he had been there.</p>

<p>But Al Faizi wuz the most took up with
lookin’ at the monuments in the Cathedral.
They wuz beautiful in the extreme,
and some on ’em wuz saints, some on
’em Archbishops, but the most on ’em
wuz riz up to men who had made themselves
famous by killin’ lots and lots of
folks&mdash;some in England, some in Russia, and in
India, and in Burmah, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>As I stood in front of them bloody records, and
meditated that a common murderer, who had only
killed one or two men, couldn’t never git a statute,
but it wuz those that killed hundreds and thousands
who had ’em built through foreign lands, and my
own native country&mdash;as I wuz a-meditatin’ on this
and a-considerin’ on how the more a man killed the
higher his monument wuz riz up, and the nigher he
wuz buried to saints, I see Al Faizi take out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
that little book with the cross on’t and write
down quite a lot&mdash;what it wuz I d’no, but I presoom
it wuz good writin’. His idees are congenial
to mine, very.</p>

<p>And then another place where I see Al Faizi
a-writin’ down quite a lot in that book of hisen wuz
at Clifford’s Tower, in the castle enclosure, where
two hundred Jews were masicreed in 1490. From
what the guide said, I made out as follows: When
the Crusaders got back from fightin’ the Infidels
they wuz kinder mad to see that the Jews wuz better
off than they wuz&mdash;had better clothes, more
money, etc.&mdash;so they begun to kill ’em off.</p>

<p>There wuz so many fightin’ Christians the Jews
couldn’t defend themselves, so they come to the
castle with their wives and children. And all the
soldiers in York come to help the Crusaders kill the
Jews. And when the poor Jews found that they
couldn’t stand it any longer, they did jest as the
Rabbi told ’em.</p>

<p>They killed the wives and children that wuz left,
to keep ’em from fallin’ into the hands of their
persecutors, and sot fire to the castle, and then
killed themselves, so’s they shouldn’t burn to death.</p>

<p>This massicre of these onoffending Jews by
Christians wuz one of the most barbarous acts that
ever took place on earth. Lots of folks now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span> have
their souls massicreed in the same way&mdash;out of envy
and jealousy.</p>

<p>I d’no what Al Faizi writ in his book as he
looked at this place where this dretful deed wuz
done in the name of Religion. But his face wuz a
sight to see as he writ&mdash;solemn and awful; not
mad, but sunthin’ of the expression of the Avengin’
Angel, or as I mistrust he would look&mdash;dretful
sorry, but sot, awful sot.</p>

<p>Wall, we went back to the tarvern and got a
good dinner, and I laid down for a nap&mdash;I wuz clean
used up.</p>

<p>When I waked up it wuz sunset, and Josiah sot
by the little casement with the panes of glass about
four inches big, a-readin’.</p>

<p>And I asked him if Martin laid out to go to
London in the mornin’, and he said that he guessed
he did. “But,” sez he with a tone of regret&mdash;</p>

<p>“I did want to visit Scarborough; there’s no
need hurryin’ so to London,” sez he.</p>

<p>“Who and what is Scarborough?” sez I in a
weary axent as I got up and wadded up my back
hair.</p>

<p>“Why, it is the fashionable waterin’-place of
England,” sez he; “it is only a little more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>forty milds away,” sez he; “we could go jest as
well as not, and it would be so genteel. I would,”
sez he, a-smoothin’ out the folds of his dressin’-gown,
and bringin’ the tossels forred in a more sightly
place&mdash;“I would love to mingle in fashionable
circles once more, Samantha.”</p>

<p>I looked down at his old bald head in silent disaprobation.
He wuz too old to hanker after fashion
and display, and too bald, and I knew it.</p>

<p>But I knew that I could not make him over,
after he had been made so long&mdash;no, I should have
to bear up the best I could under his shortcomin’s.</p>

<p>But I sez mekanically, and to git his idees off&mdash;“I
would kinder love to visit Whitby, Josiah; that
hain’t much further away, and that is where all the
most beautiful jet is made. I thought like as not
that you would want to buy me a handkerchief pin,
Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>He looked injured, and sez he, “Where is the
black pin you mourned in for Father Smith?” His
tone wuz sour and snappish in the extreme.</p>

<p>Sez I, “That pin wuz broke over twenty years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I can glue it together with
Ury’s help, or we could tie it up, so’s it would be
jest as good as a new one. It don’t come to any
strain on your collar,” sez he anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, Josiah; but I shouldn’t like to wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> a pin
that you and Ury had contoggled up. But let it
pass,” sez I; “I can do without it, if my companion
don’t think enough of me right here in the
headquarters of black breastpins and beads to buy
me anything.”</p>

<p>My tone touched him. He sez&mdash;“I’d look
round and see about it, but I hain’t no time, for
we’ve got to be a-pushin’ right on to London; if
we ever lay out to git home agin we’ve got to be
on the move.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’ only what my liniment spoke,
and anon he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“If worst come to worst, Ury and I could make
you a crackin’ good one out of coal. All of this
jet in Whitby is made out of coal. And how much
less it would cost&mdash;we could make you a hull set
in one evenin’&mdash;earrings and all.”</p>

<p>I gin him one look, and that wuz all the argument
that I would dane to waste on the subject.</p>

<p>Alice kinder wanted to go to Robin Hood Bay,
which wuz not far from Scarborough. She said
that she would love to see the place where the hero
of Sherwood Forest had lived once&mdash;the bold outlaw
who took from the rich with one hand and
gave to the poor with the other.</p>

<p>But her Pa laughed at her for believin’ that
there ever wuz sech a man, or if there wuz, he wuz
nothin’ but a common robber, who deserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
hangin’.</p>

</div>

<p>I believe Martin would favor drivin’
Santa Claus out of the country and
killin’ his reindeers. His imagination
hain’t, I really believe, not much bigger
than a pea&mdash;not a marrowfat one, but a
common field pea.</p>

<p>So Martin decided at first that we
would go direct to London, but finally
he concluded to go a little out of our
way to visit the estate of the Duke of
Devonshire&mdash;the grandest home in England.
And he wanted to stop a little
while at Sheffield on business&mdash;property
matters, I spoze, or mebby he wanted to buy a
jack-knife&mdash;I d’no what his business wuz.</p>

<p>I knew he could git a good jack-knife here, for
they’ve been makin’ knives and sech right here for
five or six hundred years.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">EDENSOR AND THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE.</p>

<p>So anon we found ourselves in the smoky, grimy,
dirty city. A heavy black cloud seemed to hang
overhead, seemin’ to shade the hull spot; but then
I didn’t want to lay it up agin ’em, for I knew we
had our own cities, that had to set down under a
cloud of smoke jest as they did&mdash;Pittsburg, and
others, etcetery.</p>

<p>I can’t say that I took sech a sight of comfort
here in Sheffield, but Josiah and Martin seemed to
enjoy themselves a-goin’ round and seein’ all they
could.</p>

<p>Martin said it wuz a sight to see how perfectly
each workman did his work, and how faithful they
wuz to their employers; he said he wished he had
sech men to work for him.</p>

<p>And it wuz curous to think on. As nigh as I
could make out, generations of one family would
work on and on, a-workin’ at one part of a jack-knife,
for instance, a-keepin’ right on&mdash;a grandpa,
and his son, and his son’s son, and etcetery&mdash;all
contented and industrious and awful handy, as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>would naterally be, a-workin’ on at one thing year
after year, year after year; mebby a-makin’ a rivet
to put into a handle of a knife.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that they would learn to do it
well after workin’ at the same thing over and over
for hundreds of years. And these workmen seemed
to be sot on doin’ jest the best
work that they could, and stay right
on in the same place.</p>

<p>“And,” sez Josiah, “I wonder if
Ury’s boy and grandson and great-grandson
will be willin’ to keep
right on workin’ for me?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Do you expect to outlive
Ury’s grandson, Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>Sez he, “They did in Bible
times.” Sez he, “I wouldn’t be
nigh so old then as Methusler,” and
he went on&mdash;“I use my help as
good agin as they do here. If I
should put Ury to work in sech a dark, dirty, onhandy
place as these workmen have, he’d kick in
a minute and leave me; but here they work, generations
of ’em, all in one place.”</p>

<div class="figright illowp59" id="i_301" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_301.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">It don’t pay to tussel with ’em.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sez I feelin’ly, “I wish I could git sech a generation
of hired girls; but no sooner duz an American
housekeeper git a hired girl broke in, so she can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>bile a potato decent, or make a batch of bread,
than off she trapes somewhere else to better herself.
It don’t pay to tussel with ’em,” sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez Josiah, “you ort to go into some of
these factories; it is a sight to see how perfect
everything is done. One part of a knife, for instance,
done in one house, and then another house
doin’ another part, and then another another, and
every part done jest as well as it can possibly be.”</p>

<p>And then Josiah went on about that wonderful
knife they make here, with a new blade added for
every year.</p>

<p>And bein’ we wuz alone, and I hadn’t nothin’
else on my mind, I moralized some, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Old Fate is makin’ her knife pretty stiddy, and
seems to add a new blade every year for us to cut
our feelin’s on, and jab ourselves with.”</p>

<p>And sez I, “They don’t hurt any the less because
we dig the metal ourselves and shape the sharp
blades with our ignorant hands, not knowin’ what
we’re a-workin’ on, and some on ’em,” sez I,
“handed down from foolish, ignorant workmen who
have gone before&mdash;queer!” sez I, “passin’ queer!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Josiah, “it wuz quite a sight; Martin
and I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“But the drinkin’ here in Sheffield,” sez Josiah,
“is sunthin’ dretful to witness.” Sez he, “I
thought we had drinkin’ habits in America, but I
never see nothin’, nor I don’t believe anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
else did, to compare with some of the places we
visited to-day. Why,” sez he, “it would do a
W. C. T. U. good to jest look at ’em.”</p>

<p>“Good?” sez I sternly.</p>

<p>“Wall, yes,” sez he; “it would set ’em to kinder
soarin’ and wavin’ them banners of theirn and talkin’&mdash;you
know jest how they love to talk,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “You better stop right where you are.”
Sez I, “Do you realize that you are talkin’ about
your pardner?”</p>

<p>“Wall, yes,” sez he; “that’s what I wuz kinder
figgerin’ on&mdash;Heaven knows you love to talk, you
can’t dispute that.”</p>

<p>I wouldn’t dane to argy with him.</p>

<p>But, indeed, it wuz a sight to walk through some
of the low, dingy, filthy streets, with saloons on
every side flauntin’ their brazen signs, and men and
wimmen with bloated, sodden faces, that strong
drink had almost changed into the faces of animals.</p>

<p>The same sin&mdash;the same useless, needless sin,
parent of <i>all</i> other vices&mdash;jest as bad on this side of
the Atlantic as in Jonesville and America, and
worse.</p>

<p>I left it there a-performin’ and cuttin’ up, and I
found it here actin’ jest the same. You’d think
after crossin’ the Atlantic it would git sobered up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span> a
little&mdash;seein’ so much water and everything.</p>

<p>But it hadn’t. It wuz jest the same reelin’, disgraceful,
foolish, leerin’, bloated Shame&mdash;</p>

<p>Jest as bad in Sheffield as it wuz in Jonesville
and Chicago, and worse.</p>

<p>It wuz enough to melt a stun with pity, and
make hard eyes weep with sorrer and flash with a
righteous indignation, at the Nations that don’t
devise some means of wipin’ out this gigantic
cause of wickedness, woe, and want.</p>

<p>They can connect worlds together with chains of
lightnin’, they can make roads through the earth
and on top of it, and in all ways; then why can’t
they keep a man from drinkin’ a tumbler full of
whiskey? They could if they wanted to, and all
put in together.</p>

<p>Wall, wuzn’t it a change to leave this smoky,
grimy city and find ourselves in the open, beautiful
English country, and in the most beautiful
part of it, too?</p>

<p>We went by railroad to Matlock Bath, and from
there went in a carriage to the little village of
Edensor, the loveliest little village I ever sot eyes
on. Its housen are all built in some quaint, beautiful
style of architecture, and it looks like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
picter, and a great deal handsomer than lots of
picters I’ve seen&mdash;chromos and sech.</p>

<p>This village belongs to the Duke of Devonshire,
and is on his estate, which is the finest in England,
and I guess on this hull earth.</p>

<p>And I d’no whether they’ve got any on any other
planet that goes ahead on’t. Mebby Jupiter has,
but I don’t really believe it.</p>

<p>Why, jest its pleasure park&mdash;the door-yard, as
you may say&mdash;has two thousand acres in it.</p>

<p>This estate, known as Chatsworth, is twelve
milds from Edensor, and nobody could describe the
beauty of the landscape all about us as we passed
onwards.</p>

<p>As we went acrost a corner of this immense
door-yard, through the most beautiful pieces of
woodland, and the verdant slopes covered with
velvety sward, great, beautiful pheasants and herds
of deer would look round at us and then walk off,
not a mite afraid, fearless as they will be if they’re
used well. Anon we would ketch a glimpse of
some enchantin’ vista, with herds of contented
cattle, makin’ picters of themselves aginst the background
of green grass and noble trees centuries old.</p>

<p>From a little hill top we could see twelve milds
in every direction, and not a foot of land that this
man didn’t own.</p>

<p>Twelve milds! the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> idee! It seems more’n he
ort to have on his mind.</p>

<p>Anon we reached a beautiful stun bridge, designed
by Michael Angelo, and crossin’ the little
river, went up to the great iron and gilt entrance
gates.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Martin sent his card in.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Martin sent his card in to somebody that takes
care of the premises, I guess (and how he dast to
ask any favors of this gorgeous-dressed creeter in
knee-breeches, I d’no, but he did, bold as brass),
and word come back that we could look over
the place, and one of the hired men wuz sent
to go with us and show us round. It wuz well
he come; we should have got lost, sure as the
world. But lost in sech a place&mdash;sech a place!
Why, I’d read the Arabian Nights quite a good
deal, and a considerable number of fairy stories
about enchanted castles, and sech. But never did
I ever hear, in a book, or out on’t, of sech magnificence
as I see here.</p>

<p>First we went through a great courtyard into
the splendid entrance hall, seventy feet long if it
wuz a inch; the wall and ceilin’s ornamented with
frescoes, all representin’ the life and death of
Cæsar. We went up a majestic staircase, with all
the richly ornamented columns and statutes it needed
for its comfort, and more, too, it seemed, though
they wuz beautiful beyend tellin’; and here we
went into the State Apartments of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>I spoze they are called State Apartments because
in every room there’s
enough of beauty and
grandeur to supply a
hull State, if it wuz
scattered even, and I
don’t mean Rhode
Island either, but New
York and Maine and
sech sizable ones.</p>

<p>Why, every one of
these lofty ceilin’s is
painted with picters
handsome enough for
the very handsomest
handkerchief pin, if they
wuz the right size. The
hired man told us what
some of the picters
represented&mdash;Aurora (and, oh, how beautiful Aurora
wuz!), and one wuz the “Judgment of
Paris.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t no idee before that Paris jedgment wuz
so perfectly beautiful; I spozed it wuz kinder triflin’.
They seemed, as fur as I could make out, to be
a-samplin’ apples&mdash;lovely creeters they wuz that wuz
standin’ round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>And then there wuz “Phaeton in the Chariot of
the Sun.”</p>

<p>It didn’t look a mite like our phaeton&mdash;fur more
magnificent.</p>

<p>Room after room opened into each other, all different
as stars differ from each other, but every one
full of glory; all full of the treasures of every land&mdash;Persia,
Egypt, and every other.</p>

<p>The hired man drawed our attention to the presents
of kings and princes, and all the rare objects of
art and virtue.</p>

<p>But I sez, “As fur as virtues is concerned, I d’no
as kings would be any more apt to git hold of ’em
than common men, or so apt, but,” sez I, “call ’em
perfectly beautiful, and I agree with you.”</p>

<p>In them magnificent and immense rooms are picters
by Landseer, Holbein, Salvator Rosa, Raphael,
Rubens, Claude Lorraine, Correggio, Hogarth,
Titian, Michael Angelo, etc. A great many with
the autographs of the painters&mdash;priceless, absolutely
beyend price, are these works of art.</p>

<p>And if I should talk a week, I couldn’t describe all
the beautiful objects we see there, so valuable that
one on ’em would make a man rich.</p>

<p>In one room wuz a clock of gold and malachite&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>present from the Emperor Nicholas, worth a
thousand guineas, and a broad, shinin’ table of one
clear sheet of transclucent spar, and a great table of
clear malachite. I’d be glad to git enough of it for
an earring for Tirzah Ann.</p>

<p>In one room we see a picter by Holbein of
Henry VIII., and a rosary belongin’ to him. I
wondered as I looked on’t what that poor, misguided
creeter ust to pray about as he handled them
beads. He couldn’t want any more wives than he
had, it seemed to me. Mebby he wuz a-wishin’
some of the time that he wuz back with Katharine,
that noble creeter who said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Weep, thou, for me in France, I for thee here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when they had that lawsuit of theirn (he gittin’
after another woman, and wantin’ to git rid of her),
after he’d bought off the jedge, Katharine sez to
Henry&mdash;liftin’ her right arm up towards Heaven&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>There</i> sits a Jedge no king can corrupt.”</p>

<p>Noble, misused creeter! I’ll bet if them beads
could have told what wuz said over ’em, they would
have said that Henry thought of her, his lawful wife,
when his memory wuz sick of recallin’ Anne
Boleyn, Anne of Cleves, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
But to resoom.</p>

<p>We see the bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span> that George II. died in. The chairs
and footstools used by George III. and his queen.
And the two chairs used by William IV. and Queen
Adelaide at their coronation. And then we see the
most beautiful tapestry that ever wuz made, and
busts and statutes. Richly colored, priceless old
china filled the splendid cabinets inlaid with finest
mosaic work&mdash;in fact, the hull length of these rooms,
openin’ into each other so that you could see their
hull length of 550 feet, wuz full of the most costly
and beautiful objects man ever made.</p>

<p>The oak floor wuz polished, and shone like a
mirror.</p>

<p>The library wuz one hundred feet long of itself,
with columns risin’ from floor to ceilin’ and a gallery
runnin’ round it, and two more openin’ out of it,
with alcoves of Spanish mahogany, these full of
picters by Landseer and others, and medallions, etc.,
etc., etc., and full of the choicest literature of
every land.</p>

<p>And then there wuz a private chapel that went
ahead of any meetin’-house I ever see or ever expect
to, all marble and spar and wonderful wood-carvin’s,
and picters from the old masters filled it full of beauty
and glory. Faith and Hope wuz there all carved
out beautiful, so’s you could see ’em right before
you, as well as feel ’em in your heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>
<p>In the sculpter gallery is the most wonderful
treasures, busts and statutes and mosaics, relicks
from every land and age, and beautiful figgers, almost
alive, by Canova, Powers, Thorwaldsen, Gibson,
Bartolini, etc., etc. Some wuz presented by
emperors and kings, and some on ’em bought by
the Duke and his folks. The hull room, one hundred
feet long, is full of the rarest treasures that
can be collected; it made my brain fairly reel beneath
my best bunnet to see the wealth of glory
and beauty, and Al Faizi turned away from it a
spell and looked thoughtfully out of the winder.</p>

<p>But I see that here, too, wuz a picter that no
artist could reproduce, and so it wuz in every winder
that you could look out of. A green, velvety
lawn a hundred feet wide and over five hundred long,
bordered by most beautiful colored flowers, and out
of another winder you could see the velvety slopes,
with walks and river and bridge, and way off the
noble trees and terraces, one risin’ above another,
all full of beautiful plants and shrubs. And in the
centre from the top down, hundreds of feet, wuz a
great flight of stun steps, thirty feet wide, down
which flows and sparkles a sheet of water, reflectin’
in its mirror-like surface all the white statutes on its
margin, till it reaches the edge of the broad gravel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>walk, when it disapears right down into the earth and
flows off in some curous, underground way to the
river.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz all rousted up when he see this, and,
as is the way of my dear, ardent-souled companion,
he tore a page out of his account-book, and begun
to make calculations on’t.</p>

<p>And I sez with a sithe&mdash;“What are you a-figgerin’
on now, Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m plottin’ out a lovely addition to the
beauty of our home, Samantha&mdash;I’m a-plannin’
sunthin’ so uneek and fascinatin’ that it will make
the Jonesvillians open their eyes in astonishment
and or.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” sez I.</p>

<p>“I’m a-plannin’ on how we can have a waterfall
on our back doorsteps.” Sez he, “I hain’t seen
anything so perfectly beautiful and strikin’ as this
sence I come to the Old Country, and we can have
one jest as well as not. You know our back steps
are quite high, and how beautiful they would look
with the sparklin’ water flowin’ down ’em&mdash;how refreshin’
it would be in hot weather to have a waterfall
right on your own doorsteps, and set in the
open back door, right on its banks, as it were, and
hear the murmur of the water, and see it a-glidin’
down towards the smoke-house. We might have it
dissapear,” sez he, “between the smoke-house and
the ash-barrel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Josiah’s home-made waterfall.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Where would you git your water?” sez I
coldly.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, a-holdin’ up the paper with quite
a lot of figgers and marks on it, “I figgered it out
that we might have a pipe go from the kitchen
pump, cut a little hole in the thrasholt to let it go
in, and there you would be.”</p>

<p>“And did you lay out,” sez I in frigid axents,
“to have me stan’ there a-pumpin’ all day to supply
your waterfall?”</p>

<p>His mean begun to fall a little&mdash;it had been triumphant&mdash;and
he sez kinder meachin’&mdash;“You
have to throw out your dish-water anyway, and you
might’s well throw it on the steps as to throw it in
the dreen.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “a fountain a-runnin’ dish-water
would be a beautiful spectacle, wouldn’t it, Josiah
Allen?</p>

<p>“I guess it would astonish the eyes of the Jonesvillians,
and their noses, too!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that!” he hollered quite loud.</p>

<p>“What did you mean, then?” sez I.</p>

<p>He agin murmured sunthin’ about the pump,
the cistern, and the old mair.</p>

<p>And I sez, “That poor old mair agin!” Sez I,
“If I hadn’t broke it up, that mair wouldn’t live
three days after we got home, with all you’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> put on
her, a-apein’ foreign idees, Josiah.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t been a-apein’, and you know it!”</p>

<p>But I went right on&mdash;“Even if you could make
it work, how could we git into the house if the
doorstep wuz turned into a waterfall?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, a-lookin’ up kinder cross, “I’ve
hearn lots of times of havin’ the bottom sash of a
winder hung on hinges, and goin’ in and out by
’em.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “after you’d clumb up through
the buttery winder onct or twict with a pail of
milk in both hands, I guess you’d git sick of doorstep
waterfalls!”</p>

<p>He see by the light of my calm, practical reasonin’
that his idee wuz visionary and couldn’t be
carried out, but he wouldn’t own up to it&mdash;not he.</p>

<p>He jest jammed the paper down into his vest
pocket, and snapped me up real sharp the next
words I said to him.</p>

<p>He acted awful growety; but I didn’t care, I
knew I wuz in the right on’t.</p>

<p>Wall, after goin’ through the brightest and most
lovely garden you can imagine, you come into a
place with huge rocks and cliffs, romantic shrubbery,
massive ledges, and a waterfall fallin’ into a
deep, dark basin, caverns, etc., and as you go
round a corner, you come face to face with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
huge rock that you think must have fell there.
You think you will have to go back; but no! Do
you think you will have to turn back for anything
in this enchanted place? The hired man touches
the rock, and it turns right away and lets you
pass, and then you see that not only is the enchantin’
beauty of the place made, but the rough
wildness of this spot.</p>

<p>One of the curous things in this place wuz a
tree with kinder queer-lookin’ branches, and the
hired man touched it somewhere, and water flowed
out of every leaf and twig, turnin’ it into a fountain.</p>

<p>The conservatory is from one end to the other
two hundred and seventy-six feet long, and broad
enough to drive through it with a carriage and
four horses, so you can imagine the wealth of
beauty in it&mdash;orange-trees full of their glossy fruit,
lemon-trees, feathery palm-trees fifty feet high,
bamboos, cactuses, bananas, queer, broad, velvety
leaves of every shape and color, and all of the
flowers that ever wuz hearn on, and never wuz
hearn on, it seems to me.</p>

<p>There are thirty other greenhousen, all runnin’
over with beauty of various kinds. Graperies
seven hundred feet long, with the rich white and
purple clusters hangin’ down in every direction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Peach housen, strawberry housen, apricot, mushroom,
vegetable housen, in which every kind of vegetable
is raised. Why, the kitchen-garden and greenhousen
covers twenty acres. But there is no use
of talkin’ any more&mdash;like Niagara, and the World’s
Fair, you have got to see it to understand its vastness
and its perfect beauty.</p>

<p>I wuz glad I’d seen it. I believe that even Martin
wuz kinder took down off from the Mount
of Self Esteem he always sets on, as he wandered
through it.</p>

<p>He’d always prided himself quite a good deal of
his home in the city, and it is palatial and grand.
But what comparison would it bear to this? Not
even&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like moonshine unto sunshine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or like water unto wine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No; it wuz like a small kerosene lamp unto sunshine.
And he felt it, Martin did. He didn’t
patronize anybody for as much as three quarters of
an hour after he left there. He give the hired man
a good-sized piece of money, for I see him. It wuz
so big that the man turned fairly pale, and called
Martin “Your Highness.” He sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“When will Your Highness return again?”</p>

<p>So we come off with flyin’ colors, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span> all.</p>

<p>Wall, seein’ that we wuz so near, Martin thought
we’d ride over to Haddon Hall, only a few milds
away. This is one of the fine old buildin’s of the
Middle Ages. It stands on a rocky eminence above
the River Wye; over the great arched entrance is
the arms of the Vernon family, who occupied it for
three hundred and fifty years.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp73" id="i_319" style="max-width: 10em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>Her common-sense shoe.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As we passed in through a little door, cut in one
of the broad sides of the gates, we see, on the rough
stun thrasholt, the impression of a human foot,
wore there by the innumerable feet of warriors, pilgrims,
ladies, troubadors, children, kings, and queens,
for all I know. Anyhow, she who wuz once Smith
put her own common-sense shoe right into the
worn footprint, and stood there, kinder on one foot,
and had more’n eighty-seven emotions as she did so,
and I d’no but eighty-nine or ninety.</p>

<p>I had a sight, anyway, as we went into the stun
courtyard, ornamented with stun carvin’, into the
interior.</p>

<p>Josiah didn’t take to it at all.</p>

<p>But, then, as I told him, what could you expect
of a house where the folks had been away for several
hundred years&mdash;any place would look kinder
dreary.</p>

<p>But he sez, “Dum it all! when it wuz new, who’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
like to have sech rough stun floors? And look at
that fireplace in the kitchen, big enough to roast a
hull ox. How could a man cut wood enough to
keep that fire a-goin’?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “The man of the house didn’t have to do
it at all, his vassals did it, Josiah.”</p>

<p>“Wall, he had to tend to it, and I’d ruther do
the work any time than to keep a vassal a-goin’,
that is, any vassal that I ever hired by the month,
or day.”</p>

<p>But in the great banquettin’ hall, with its oak
rafters and long table, where they feasted, at one
end a little higher&mdash;for the quality, I spoze&mdash;he
ketched sight of the minstrels’ gallery at one end.
And sez he, his face lightin’ up, “The man of the
house could git up there and sing while the rest
wuz eatin’, if he wanted to, and nothin’ said
about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I pintedly, “if he <i>could</i> sing; but,”
sez I, wantin’ to git his mind offen this unpleasant
theme, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’d love dearly to see this table set out as it ust
to be, and the noble and beautiful a-settin’ round it,
with boars’ heads on the table, and great
sides of beef, and gilded peacocks.”</p>

<p>“And jugs of ale and wine,” sez
Josiah.</p>

<p>But I waved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> off that idee, but couldn’t wave it
fur, for the beer cellars wuz a sight to behold.
They must have been drunk a good deal of the time,
jedgin’ from the accommodations for drinkin’.</p>

<p>Up the massive stun stairway we went into
another big room, used as a dinin’-room by the later
occupants of the Hall.</p>

<p>Here over the fireplace are the royal arms, and
under them, in old English letters, the motto&mdash;</p>

<p>“Drede God, and honor the king.”</p>

<p>Goin’ up six heavey, oak, semicircular steps, we
go into the ball-room, over a hundred feet long, with
great bay-winders, out of which you see picters
more beautiful than any that could be painted by
the hand of man&mdash;perfect landscape of quiet
country, silvery stream, rustic bridges, grand old
parks, and the spire of the church from the distant
village pintin’ up to the blue sky.</p>

<p>Then through other rooms with Gobelin tapestry
on the walls, still holdin’ skripteral stories in its
ancient folds.</p>

<p>Then through other rooms that are modern compared
with the others, and have been used in the
present century. Here, agin, in one of ’em we see
Gobelin tapestry drapin’ the State bed.</p>

<p>Follerin’ the guide through a anty-room we come
out into the garden on Dorothy Vernon’s Walk.</p>

<p>Under the tapestry is concealed doors and passages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
as the guide showed us by pushin’ the folds
aside, through which many a man or woman, drove
by Fear or Love, or some other creeter, had rushed
for refuge or secret meetin’.</p>

<p>The garden of Haddon Hall is picturesque and
beautiful in the extreme.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s Walk, shaded by noble old trees, leads
to the massive flights of marble steps, down which
she hurried with beatin’ heart and flyin’ steps to
meet her lover, Sir John Manners, while her friends
were merry-makin’ in another part of the Hall, and
never dreamed of her flight.</p>

<p>Haddon Hall by this means passed into the
family of Rutland, who lived here till the first of
this century. The Duke of Rutland keeps the
place in its ancient form, much to the delight of
those who love the old ways.</p>

<p class="h2sub">JOSIAH HAS AN ADVENTURE.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin, who sometimes changes his
mind, but don’t think he duz, always a-sayin’ that
it shows weak-mindedness and is a trait belongin’
to wimmen (which I never
feel like disputin’, knowin’
that my sect has in time past
been known to be whifflin’;
but so have men, too)&mdash;so it
didn’t surprise me much when
he said that instead of proceedin’
directly to the Lake District
from here he thought we
would go first to the home of Shakespeare. Sez
he:</p>

<p>“I may be called to London any minute on
business, and I feel that it will be expected of me
to visit Shakespeare’s birthplace anyway.”</p>

<p>Sez Martin, with a thumb in both vest pockets,
and a benine, patronizin’ look on his liniment&mdash;</p>

<p>“Shakespeare wrote a number of very creditable
productions, and though I never had the time to
spare from more important things to peruse his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
works&mdash;poems, I believe, mostly&mdash;yet I always love
to encourage talent. I think it is becoming for solid
men, for progressive, practical men, to encourage
writers to a certain extent; and Shakespeare, as
I am aware, has been very much talked of. I would
be sorry to miss the chance of saying to those who
inquire of me that I had been there, so I believe
we will proceed there at once.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” I sez, “I shall be glad enough to go;”
and Al Faizi looked tickled, too. He had read him,
he said, in his own country.</p>

<p>And sez he to me, with his dark eyes all lit up,
“To read Shakespeare is like looking into clear
water and seeing your own face reflected in it, and
earth, and mountain top, and over all the Heavens.
And it is more than that,” sez he, “it is looking into
the human mind and reading all its secrets&mdash;all the
wonder and mystery of the soul; it is like looking
at life, and death, and eternity.”</p>

<p>He wuz dretful riz up in his mind a-talkin’ about
it, and he quoted Shakespeare quite often on our
way to Stratford, and always in the right place, and
he is generally so still, that I see, indeed, how he felt
about him. Alice talked, too, quite a good deal
about Shakespeare. And Al Faizi listened. Yes,
he listened to Alice&mdash;poor creeter! And everybody
blind as a bat but jest me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>Wall, we got there anon or a little before, and put
up to the Red Horse Inn, a quaint, old-fashioned
tarvern, but where we had everything for our comfort,
and wuz waited on by as pretty a red-cheeked
girl as I want to see.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp100" id="i_322" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_322.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A quaint, old-fashioned tarvern.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A sight of emotions wuz rousted up in me as I
sot in that tarvern, or walked through its old-fashioned,
low-ceiled rooms and meditated on who had
been under its ruff.</p>

<p>When rare Ben Jonson, and Drayton, and Garrick,
and all of Shakespeare’s friends come down
from London to visit him, of course they stopped
here, and of course Shakespeare himself often and
often come here&mdash;mebby too often for Miss Shakespeare’s
feelin’s.</p>

<p>Much as I honor Shakespeare, I have to admit
that he did stimulate a little too much&mdash;but, then,
who hain’t got their failin’s? Why, Solomon, the
very wisest man, had more wives than he ort to
had.</p>

<p>Seein’, I spoze, that we wuz Americans, our supper
that first night wuz served in Washington
Irving’s room, as they call the room that he occupied,
our own genial wit and poet. Mebby his
words didn’t come in rhyme, but they had the soul of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>poetry, and quaint, sly wit, and good sense and good
manners and everything.</p>

<p>I always sot store by Washington Irving. (I
had got acquainted with him through Thomas J.)</p>

<p>Alice quoted a lot from Irving, and a lot from
Shakespeare, while we wuz to the table, and I felt
their presence in my heart.</p>

<p>Wall, I wuz so kinder beat out that night, that,
as poets say, “I sought my couch” to once, a good-lookin’
oak bedstead, with a teester cloth overhead,
and some curtains hangin’ down on each side.</p>

<p>The weariness I had gone through with that day,
mixed in with the powders Mr. Morpheus keeps by
him, brung on a sleep almost imegiately and to once.
And I wuz sweetly a-dreamin’ of seein’ the Jonesville
steeple a-pintin’ up through a ile paintin’ of cows
and calves. Philury wuz a-peacefully milkin’ one of
the cows, while Ury, a-settin’ on the steeple with a
pail of skim milk, wuz a-tryin’ to bagon one of the
calves to him, but a Madonna with a long beard
poked at the calf with a sceptre and made it kick.</p>

<p>It wuz a sweet, tender dream of home, tinged
slightly with the surroundin’s we had been surrounded
by on our tower.</p>

<p>But anon as the Madonna and Philury changed
into two gorgeous altar pieces, and Ury leaned near
the calf and fed it out of a stained-glass winder&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>
<p>Even at that very minute a sharp scream cut
through the silence of night, like the ragged thrust
of a bread knife through a loaf of light bread.</p>

<p>Once, twice, three times, did that cry ring out,
and then I heard the sounds of rapid footsteps, and
anon the door busted open, and my pardner rushed
in and slammed it shet and clicked the bolt to.</p>

<p>And then he sunk down in his chair and almost
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>I riz up on my piller, and sez I in agitated
axents&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Josiah?”</p>

<p>Sez he from out from under his hand, “I’ve done
it now!”</p>

<p>“Done what?” sez I.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me!” sez he, a-shudderin’ visibly; “it
is nothin’ you want to know.”</p>

<p>But his words made me more and more determined
to know the worst, as wuz nateral they
should. And finally he said in a surly, cross
way&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, if you must know, I’ve been into a
woman’s room.”</p>

<p>“Been into a woman’s room!” sez I coldly;
“what did you want in a woman’s room?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want nothin’&mdash;Heaven knows I didn’t,
only to git out agin.”</p>

<p>“Who wuz it?” sez I in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span> stern axents.</p>

<p>“I d’no&mdash;she wuz a perfect stranger to me,”
sez he, with his face still hid in his hand.</p>

<p>“Wuz she good-lookin’?” sez I in the same stern
tones. I hain’t a mite jealous, as is well known,
but I felt that I wanted to know the worst.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” sez he; and he continued fiercely,
“What business has a woman to be up a-ondressin’
herself at this time of night? Why wuzn’t she
to bed and covered up?”</p>

<p>Sez he, a-growin’ more and more excited and
fierce actin’&mdash;“I’m a-goin’ back and tell that
woman that it is a shame and a disgrace to be up
and ondressed at this time of night. Why wuzn’t
her door locked, if she had to ondress?”</p>

<p>“What business wuz it of yours?” sez I. “Do
you spoze she expected you to be a-prowlin’ round
her room and a-prancin’ in, onbeknown to her?”</p>

<p>“Gracious Peter!” sez he in pitiful axents; “duz
she think I wanted to be there?”</p>

<p>“Why did you go in, then?” sez I.</p>

<p>“Because I made a mistake!” he thundered out.
“I thought it wuz our room. How should I know
that there wuz a dum, red-headed fool there a-ondressin’
herself at this time of night? Why wuzn’t
she abed&mdash;up, and skairin’ a man half to death?”</p>

<p>“If you’d kep’ out, Josiah, you’d have escaped,”
sez I more softer like, for I see by his axents that
he wuz a-sufferin’ from fear and the effects of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>the
shock.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Be calm; accidents will happen, Josiah.
Come to bed, and try to forgit it.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Sez he, “I’m a-goin’ back&mdash;it is my duty.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I won’t try!” sez he. “I’m a-goin’ back and
give that dum fool and loonatick a piece of my
mind. What henders
some other man from
walkin’ in?” Sez he,
“I’m a-goin’ back&mdash;it
is my duty!”</p>

<p>I riz up and laid
holt of him, and sez I,
“Do you stay where
you be, Josiah Allen.
I should think you’d
done enough for one
night.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “What henders Martin and Fazer from
walkin’ in jest as I did, and bein’ skairt to death?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Martin and Al Faizi know enough to
take care of themselves, and it is your place to go
to bed and behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“A-ondressin’ herself at this time of night!” he
kep’ a-mutterin’ as he put his vest down on a chair.</p>

<p>“What are you a-doin’?” sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall, there hain’t a lot of strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span> wimmen
round, is there?”</p>

<p>I see it wuz vain to dispute the pint. He acted
deeply injured, and as if the woman had made a
plot to skair him, and I had to gin up the idee of
wringin’ any jestice out of his words and demeanors
in the case.</p>

<p>But the next mornin’ he felt calmer, and didn’t
seem to blame her so much, and admitted that she
had to ondress, and said of his own accord that
mebby he had been too hard on her.</p>

<p>But he wuzn’t quite reconciled, I could see, and
felt deeply that he might have escaped the shock if
she hadn’t ondressed.</p>

<p>Wall, our first visit wuz to Shakespeare’s birth-place.
We sot out bright and early.</p>

<p>It is a long, old-fashioned-lookin’ house, with
three gabriel ends in the ruff on front, and kinder
criss-cross-lookin’, some like a big checker-board,
the cross pieces of oak filled in with plaster, I
should jedge.</p>

<p>We first went into the kitchen, with its wide,
open fireplace, and how I felt when I thought that
here, right here, in this spot, the immortal Shakespeare
had often sot, with his feet and face burnin’
hot, and his back a-freezin’, as is the way with them
old fireplaces!</p>

<p>But no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> his body felt or didn’t feel,
think of that mind, that soul that wuz caged in here
between these narrer and queer-lookin’ walls.
What visions them eager, bright eyes ust to see in
the burnin’ flames! What shadders and shapes the
clouds of smoke took as they floated up and away!
How his soul follered ’em! How he sailed off into
strange heights and depths, sech as no other writer
ever did, or can, foller and explore! How the
mind of the Infinite must have brooded over that
little sleeper that lay over three hundred years ago
in that low, shabby room upstairs&mdash;a small, dreary-lookin’
apartment, with the walls covered with the
names of visitors and verses, etc.</p>

<p>We went up to it on a steep, narrer stairway.
Martin had to take off his tall hat or he couldn’t
have got in&mdash;I d’no whether he would or not
if he hadn’t had to. I wuz proud to see that my
pardner took off his hat the minute we got inside;
I wuz proud of the reverence he showed
for genius, and told him so.</p>

<p>But he said he forgot that it wuzn’t meetin’,
it seemed some like it, he said, all dressed up
at ten in the mornin’, and goin’ off all together.</p>

<p>After I spoke he wuz a-goin’ to put his hat on
agin, but I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you’ve blundered into reverential and noble
ways, Josiah Allen, don’t, for pity sake, break it
up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>Of course my pardner always takes off his hat
when goin’ into housen, visitin’, or callin’, or sech,
or in our own residence. But on our travels, goin’
through big, cold buildin’s, dungeons, etc., he’s made
a practice of keepin’ it on, bein’ bald, and sufferin’
in his scalp from cold.</p>

<p>But here, in this place, this hant of genius, I felt
for about the first time sence I had been huntin’
antiquities, that I’d love to take off my own bunnet
and dress-cap, but I spozed that the move would
draw attention and call forth remarks, so I kep’
’em on.</p>

<p>But my sperit knelt bareheaded and bowed itself
down before this shrine of Wisdom and Genius, this
earthly abode of one who showed what a grand and
divine thing the human mind may be; who held the
secret of all things common and transcendent&mdash;all
things “that are dreamed of in our philosophy”
and more&mdash;</p>

<p>This magician, who showed “what fools we mortals
be,” and showed to what heights of wisdom men
may attain&mdash;</p>

<p>Who held up his wonderful microscope and let
mortals look through it into the inside of their own
hearts and feelin’s and emotions. And who held
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>up a lookin’-glass to Mom Nater, so she could see
her old face in it, every beauty and every deformity&mdash;</p>

<p>Who plunged us into the depths of sorrerful and
heart-breakin’ experience, bewitched us with his wit,
and brung us up so clost to the divine good that
we almost feel the beatin’ of the great heart of
love.</p>

<p>Wonderful magician, indeed, and havin’ sech feelin’s
for him for years and years (ketched a good
deal from Thomas J., who admires him beyend any
tellin’), I felt that it wuz strange indeed that she
who wuz once Smith should stand right here in the
place where he had once lived.</p>

<p>Al Faizi felt jest as I did, only more so&mdash;jest as
still waters run deepest. I could talk with my companion
yet, and the others, but he stood reverent
and silent, and walked through the rooms like one
in a dream, in which sech visions come that it “give
us pause.”</p>

<p>But, as I say, I could still talk some&mdash;I seem to
be made that way that conversation is hard to
smother in my breast. Lots of wimmen are made
jest so, and men too.</p>

<p>Martin wuz talkin’ fluently to Alice and Adrian
as they went from spot to spot in the old house,
and Martin wuz, I spozed, a-layin’ up a fount of
memories that the public could tap, and valuable
information would flow for their refreshin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>But anon I missed my pardner; but even as my
Thought wuz a-reachin’ after him, as it always must
while it is yoked to my constant Heart, he come up
to me with joy in his mean and a piece of paper in
his hand, and sez he, with a glad and joyous axent,
in which, too, pride wuz blendin’, about a third of
each ingregient a-makin’ up his hull mean.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I have been a-writin’ a poem in the
visitors’ book, Samantha, and I copied it off for
you on a leaf out of my account book&mdash;I knew that
you would want to see it, and then I shall keep the
copy in my tin trunk with my money and deeds.”</p>

<p>I groaned instinctively, but suppressed it all I
could as I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let me know the worst to once! What have
you writ?”</p>

<p>He proudly ondid the paper, and I read&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I, Josiah,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Am settin’ by the fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Am right on the spot</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where Shakespeare sot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’m proud to be there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though I spoze, from what Samantha sez, that it hain’t the same chair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There,” sez he proudly, as he folded up the paper,
and put it into his portmoney. “There hain’t
a verse here on these hull walls or on the visitors’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
book that will compare with that.”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I coldly, “there hain’t&mdash;Heaven knows
there hain’t.”</p>

<p>Sez he proudly, “It has three great qualities,
Samantha&mdash;it is terse, melodious, and truthful.
Shakespeare’s chair wuz sold two hundred years ago
to a Russian princess, and they’ve kep’ on a-sellin’
the original chair several times sence, so how could
it be here? If I’d been writin’ in prose, I should a
said that it wuz a dum humbug!”</p>

<p>And here he paused reflectively and dreamily.</p>

<p>“I might have said sunthin’ strong and strikin’
here&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘It makes me mad as a June bug</div>

    <div class="verse right">‘<span class="smcap">Josiah.</span>’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You know that June bugs hum,” and he murmured
dreamily, “humbug, and bughum; it would
have been very ingenious, and I might say sunthin’
strong about ‘tire,’ to rhyme with ‘Josiah,’ about
relicks bein’ made to order. ‘It makes me tired,’
you know, only have it come all in poetry,” sez he;
“it would be dretful appro<i>poss</i>.”</p>

<p>Sez I coldly, “What you mean by that, I don’t
have any idee.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>
<p>“Why,” sez he, “I see it in <i>The World</i>; it is
French, and it means to have anything come in
appropriate&mdash;appro<i>poss</i>, you know. I should have
used it in my poem, but I couldn’t think of anything
to rhyme with it but hoss.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “<i>Tire</i> is a good word to use in connection
with your poetry. Everybody would appreciate
it, and hail it with effusion.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez he with a wise air, “you have to be so
careful in poetry. You can’t use strong phrases
much, if any. And then, knowin’ that I wuz
writin’ in the same book with kings, etc., I felt
that it must be genteel and stylish. And I knew
you always loved to be remembered, and so I
brung your name in, Samantha.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “you brung it in in sech a way
as to hurt his folkses feelin’s as long as they make
them chairs of hisen.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “it looks well for pardners to
remember each other, and it’s a rare quality, too.”</p>

<p>I felt that he wuz right, and didn’t dispute him,
and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Samantha, I wanted you to be jined with me
on the pillow of fame. I don’t want to be anywhere
where you hain’t, Samantha.”</p>

<p>His tenderness touched my heart, and I kep’
still and let him go on, only I merely remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>“As for its bein’ melodious, Josiah, your first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
line has got 2 words in it, and your last one
seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “that’s the way with great
writers&mdash;they warm with their subject as they go
on, and git all het up with inspiration. Jest think
of Browning and Walt Whitman.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Don’t go to comparin’ that verse of
yourn with Browning. Why, folks know what you
wuz a-writin’ about! Don’t compare yourself with
Robert Browning.”</p>

<p>He see in a minute his deep mistake&mdash;he see
that folks could find out what he’d undertook to
write about.</p>

<p>“Wall, Walt Whitman,” sez he, “he writ jest as
long and short lines. I’ve seen ’em to home in
that ‘Leaves of Grass’ Thomas J. owns.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I wish your grass wuz to home, too,” sez
I; “but,” sez I, a-sithin’ hard, “I’ve got to stand it,
I spoze. But,” sez I warmly, “there hain’t a spot,
from Egypt to Jonesville, but what I’d ruther had
you broke out into poetry in than in this house.”</p>

<p>And I turned onto my heel and left him, feelin’
cheap as dirt about it, though I comforted myself
with the thought that his poetry wuzn’t the only
foolish lines writ there.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Shakespeare’s ghost reading the effusions on the
walls of his house.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I believe that if Shakespeare’s ghost comes back
and hants this old spot&mdash;as it seems likely to spoze
it duz&mdash;about the hardest thing it has to bear is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
to read the effusions
writ all over the walls
and in the visitors’
book, though some
on ’em are quite good.</p>

<p>Prince Lucian writ
a very good verse.
But, then, he writ in
it that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He shed jest <i>one</i> tear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How under the sun
anybody can make
calculations ahead on
sheddin’ jest <i>one</i> tear,
no more, no less, is a
mystery to me, and
it must have been
jest out of one eye,
and not the other.</p>

<p>But bein’ a Prince,
I spoze he done it;
but I never could.
I couldn’t calculate closter than a dozen or twenty
before I begun to cry, and I couldn’t cry with one
eye and keep the other dry to save my life.</p>

<p>Our own Washington Irving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span> writ quite a good
verse, and so did the American Hackett&mdash;the best
actor of some of Shakespeare’s characters.</p>

<p>Lots of actors have left their names in the room
where the poet wuz born&mdash;Edmund Kean, Charles
Kean, and a great many others. And in the visitors’
book you see writin’s from kings to chore-boys,
and lines in every language&mdash;English, German,
French, Chinese, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish,
etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Poet of the World has the world come to
do honor to his memory.</p>

<p>Next to the thought that I wuz under the ruff
that bent over the head of Shakespeare wuz to
see the writin’ of some who had writ their names
on the low walls.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens! Why, jest to look on that one
name, writ by his own hand, would have been
enough, if I had been to home, to furnished me
with deep emotions for ten days. Nobody knows
what my feelin’s have always been for that man.</p>

<p>It hain’t quite so fashionable to love Dickens
now as it ust to be. The world has grown older
and more genteel, and seems to prize more the
writin’s it can’t understand&mdash;the vaguer ones and
more cross like, and morbid, “Is Life Worth Living”&mdash;“No,
it hain’t.”</p>

<p>“How to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>Happy though Married.”</p>

<p>Ibsen, Tolstoi, etc., etc., etc., and so forth and so
on.</p>

<p>But I lay out to like Dickens till, like Barkis,
the high water comes, and&mdash;“I go out with the
tide.”</p>

<p>So his name, the Master, I laid my hand on’t,
and had ninety-seven emotions durin’ that time, and
I presoom more, though truly I didn’t count ’em.</p>

<p>And Thackeray, who laughs with us over the
weaknesses of humanity, yet once in a great while
strikes sech a hard and onexpected blow onto our
hearts and feelin’s, that we look right under that
cynical veil he chose to wear, and see the great,
tender heart of the man. His name, writ by his
own hand, gin me powerful emotions, and sights on
’em.</p>

<p>Lord Byron’s name rousted me up some. Poor,
onhappy, restless creeter! I wuz always sorry for
him&mdash;sorry he wuz so mean and grand too&mdash;dretful
grand. I spoze he wuz so onhappy that he couldn’t
help lettin’ it run off the ends of his fingers sometimes
onto the paper.</p>

<p>Some of his poetry uplifts you, like bein’ on a
mountain-top in a storm, and some is like a calm
moonlight night in the tropics, and still there is
some on’t that I never felt willin’ that Josiah Allen
should read&mdash;I felt that it would be resky to allow
it. As I looked at his signature I instinctively sez<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
over to myself a verse of hisen, that always seemed
to be kinder open-hearted, and ownin’ up, and had
a good deal of human nater in it. Some despair
and some plain curosity&mdash;they always seem to
touch a chord in everybody’s nater&mdash;I guess that
most everybody sometimes feels jest about so, jest
so kinder curous to know what is comin’ next&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“My whole life was a contest since the day</div>

<p>Wall, he see the last thing arrive that we know
anything about here. What come next, after he
shet his eyes in Greece (dyin’ nobly, anyway) we
can’t tell. But probble the one who formed that
strange soul knew jest what it needed the most,
and deserved.</p>

<p>Probble that was the&mdash;“The next thing that arrived.”</p>

<p>But I am indeed a-eppisodin’, and to resoom&mdash;</p>

<p>Then there wuz Sir Walter Scott, and Tennyson,
and Longfellow, and everybody else, as you may
say, who have distinguished themselves in literature
and art, and lots of Lords and Ladies, but them I
didn’t mind so much, knowin’ that for the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
part that they had been born into their lofty places
onbeknown to ’em, but the others had made the
high pinnacles for themselves, and then stood up on
’em.</p>

<p>In another room we see lots of relicks of the past.
Josiah nudged me once or twict a-lookin’ at ’em, I
spoze to call attention to his poetry and his doubts.
But I declined to be nudged, and never looked up
at him at all, but kep’ my eye on the relicks.</p>

<p>One is a seal ring of Shakespeare’s, with his
initials, W. S., tied together with a true lover’s knot.
It wuz found near Stratford meetin’-house, twenty
years ago and over, and is spozed to be really his
ring, as he said sunthin’ in his will that shows that
he had lost his seal ring.</p>

<p>Then there is a letter writ to Shakespeare by
Richard Quincy, askin’ the loan of some money.</p>

<p>I sez to Josiah, “Whether he got it or not, if he
could come back now he could sell that letter of
hisen for enough to make him comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Josiah; “I would give fifty cents for
it myself, or seventy-five, if he would take it in provisions.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” sez I, “you couldn’t git it for that, for
this letter, I feel, is genuine. It seems so nateral,
borrowin’ money of a writer. Why,” sez I, “truth
is stomped onto it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Then there wuz the desk that Shakespeare sot at
when a boy. A rough, battered desk it wuz, with
the lid lifted by leather hinges.</p>

<p>I sot down to it and leaned my head onto my
hand and thought&mdash;thought&mdash;of how he felt when
he wuz a-settin’ at it, and wondered if he had boyish
joys or boyish sorrers jest like the rest of children.
And if he scribbled poetry when he ort to be studyin’
his rithmetic, and whether old Miss Shakespeare,
his ma, sent him off to school happy, with
fond words and a kiss, or kinder mad from a
spankin’.</p>

<p>To spank Shakespeare! My soul revolted from
the thought.</p>

<p>Or whether, while he sot here, he studied his
schoolmates and teachers with eyes that must have
held some fur-seein’ wisdom in ’em even at that age,
or whether his mind wuz all took up with goin’ in
a-swimmin’ in the clear waters of Avon, or a-goin’
a huntin’, or a-nuttin’ in his rich neighbor’s woods,
Sir Thomas Lucy, who looked down with sech
disdain on William when a boy and a young man,
and now whose only earthly chance of bein’ held in
any remembrance is the fact that he misused
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But then mebby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span> William wuz tryin’, boys are
sometimes.</p>

<p>I wondered if while he wuz a-settin’ here where I
sot any dreams of Anne Hathaway begun to come
into his brain. She must have been about eighteen,
allowin’ that William wuz ten; mebby some dreams
of the pretty young girl hanted the boy’s vision,
edgin’ themselves in between thoughts of play and
study. But before long them little dreams wuz
a-goin’ to rise up and push every other vision out
of his mind.</p>

<p>And then there wuz Shakespeare’s jug, and the
old sign of the Falcon&mdash;I hated to see ’em.</p>

<p>And some old deeds and documents relatin’ to
his father’s property, from John Shackspere and
Mary his wyffe, and a deed with Gilbert Shakspere’s
autograph on it.</p>

<p>And lots of engravin’s of different places about
Stratford, and a great many portraits of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! if he and Columbus have got
acquainted with each other where they be now, as
I spoze it is nateral to think they have, how they
must sympathize with each other over the numerous
faces they wuz said to have had on this planet!
Noble creeters, it wuz too bad, when they only had
one apiece, and good, noble-lookin’ ones, I most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>know, or they wuz, anyway, when they got older,
for Time, the sculptor, must have sculped some of
their noble traits into their faces.</p>

<p>Martin and Alice bought quite a number of
steroscopic views, and I bought a few, and would,
though Josiah looked askance at me as I did it, and
we left the cottage. But I laid my hand on the
doorway as I went out, as though it wuz a shrine,
as indeed it wuz.</p>

<p>Wall, havin’ seen the place where he wuz born,
we naterally wanted to see the place where he is
a-layin’, where “After life’s fitful fever he sleeps
well,” havin’ “Ended the heartache, and all the
natural ills that flesh is heir to.”</p>

<p>So we sot out for Holy Trinity Church. New
Place, as it wuz called, where Shakespeare spent the
last days of his life, and where his girl entertained
Queen Henriette, wuz torn down in 1757 by its
owner, who had moved away, and didn’t want to
pay the heavey taxes levied on it. While livin’
there, he had cut down the mulberry-tree Shakespeare
planted, because folks thronged into his
garden so, and cut off twigs, etc., for relicks; so he
cut it down.</p>

<p>It seems mean in him, and then, on the other
hand, it would be hard for us to be broke in on any
hour of the day, sometimes when we had a hard
headache, and wanted to set quiet under our own
vine and mulberry-tree, to have a gang of enthusiastick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
tourists come, and not only break up your
quiet, but break off your branches over your achin’
head, and mebby recite Shakespeare right there in
broad daylight, and declaim, and elocute, and act.</p>

<p>It would be tuff&mdash;tuff both ways. But the young
folks of Stratford wuzn’t megum&mdash;they didn’t try
to see on all sides, as she who wuz once Smith tries
to do, so they used to pelt his winder with stuns
and things, so he moved out. And much as I
honor and revere Shakespeare, I feel kinder sorry
for the man, mebby because nobody else seems to
say a decent word for him. But I believe he see
trouble, with taxes, tourists, elocution, and sech.
And because our eyes are sot on a blazin’ sun that
is shinin’ high in the Heavens, it hain’t no sign that
we ort to kick over every kerosene lamp and candle
that we come acrost. No; less be jest to all, and
respect what is respectable in ’em, and be sorry for
humble trials, as well as proud of lofty glories.</p>

<p>But to resoom&mdash;The house that stands on the
spot now is owned by the town, and is a museum
of Shakespeare’s relicks and souvneirs. It is needless
to say how many emotions I had as I walked
onwards towards the tomb of the greatest writer
who has ever appeared on our planet&mdash;in fact, I
couldn’t count ’em or begin to, if there wuz any
need on’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>Nor nobody couldn’t see the crowd that walked
with me&mdash;King Lear, with sweet Cordelia a kinder
holdin’ him up; eloquent Portia, Lady Macbeth&mdash;the
Henrys and Richards&mdash;the bright-faced Shrew
that wuz tamed&mdash;Prince Hamlet&mdash;Ophelia a-babblin’
her love ditties&mdash;Imogene&mdash;poor Desdemona,
and her folks, and etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. How
they pressed round me!&mdash;a great deal nigher to me
than Adrian wuz, though I wuz a-leadin’ him by
the hand.</p>

<p>The church stands near the banks of the sweet
Avon. And we went up to it by a avenue of trees,
and through a great Gothic door, into a porch that
led into the church itself. The old sexton, who had
onlocked the door for us, at our request led us
right up to the monument, which is in a niche in
the chancel, and is spozed to be a perfect likeness, as
it wuz made by a sculptor who wuz acquainted
with Shakespeare, and who had a death mask to
work from.</p>

<p>There he stands or sets, as the case may be, for a
sort of a marble cushion comes up in front of him,
and you can’t see quite to the bottom of his
vest.</p>

<p>He stands (or sets) with that high, noble forward
and good-lookin’ featers, and eyes that look clear
through your soul, and that deep collar of hisen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>on,
under a arch that has some cupids up on each side
on top, and coats-of-arms, and skulls, and things.</p>

<p>And there he has stood (or sot) through the centuries,
jest as I spoze he would wanted to, with a
paper in one hand and a pen in the other, to all
appearance a-writin’, and the hull world a-readin’ it.</p>

<p>In front of the altar rails are the marble slabs
over the graves of the Shakespeare family, among
them his wife, Anne Hathaway; it reads as follers&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here lyeth interred the body of Anne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wife of William Shakspere, who depted this life the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">6 day of Aug. 1623, being of the age of 67 years.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another slab marks the grave of Susanna, the
poet’s daughter.</p>

<p>But, of course, the slab that gin me the biggest
sized emotions, and the greatest number on ’em, wuz
the one over the poet, which has these mysterious
and immortal lines on’t&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good friend, for Jesu’s sake forbeare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To digg the dust encloased heare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cursed be he yt moves my bones.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I had a immense emotions of or as I read these
words, and dassent hardly lay my hand on’t. But
made up my mind that as I didn’t have no idee of
movin’ his bones, and laid out to spare the stuns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span> I
might venter.</p>

<p>There are them that think that some great secret
wuz buried with Shakespeare&mdash;them are the ones
that are so sot on thinkin’ that Bacon wuz the one
who writ the great plays, and they say in this very
inscription is hid in cypher a confession that Bacon
writ ’em.</p>

<p>But I didn’t seem to think so, nor Josiah didn’t,
though he wuz all took up with the idee of the
cypher, as Martin broached it.</p>

<p>Sez he, “How beautiful it would be, and how
stylish, to write to you when you’re off on your towers
with a cypher! I could write it in poetry, and it
would be so uneek, and if I wanted to complain to
you about the children, or Ury, or anything, how
handy it would be!”</p>

<p>“But,” I sez, “in answer to that idee of yourn,
I can quote to you the first line of Shakespeare’s
epitaph, and I feel it, too,” sez I.</p>

<p>He went back and read it over agin, and come
back lookin’ real puggicky.</p>

<p>But I see that other folks had felt jest as I did
about disturbin’ the slab, for it looked fresh and
new, while the other ones near it wuz all worn with
the footprints of time and the tourists; and when
the poet’s wife and daughter died, they wanted dretful
to be laid by William, but they dassent open the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
grave. The curse he threatened held ’em back.</p>

<p>Queer! I wish I knew what he meant by it,
but can’t; the silence of three hundred years can’t
be broke by one small woman’s voice, or ruther one
woman’s small voice. No answer comes to our
deep wonder and curosity.</p>

<p>In this church is the font where Shakespeare wuz
baptized&mdash;this wuz in the church at the time of his
birth, but wuz took out in the seventeenth century,
and replaced by a new one; this old one lay for years
in a heap of rubbish, and wuz used for a pump
trough for a spell&mdash;jest think on’t!</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_350.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>The font in which Shakespeare was baptized.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is other interestin’ things in the church,
but we didn’t wait to see ’em. We went out and
wandered for a spell around the quaint streets of
Stratford. Every shop almost has souvneirs to sell
of the great man&mdash;busts and medallions and picters
of him and his home, and his tomb, and carvin’s,
engravin’s, etc., etc. I <i>would</i> buy a plate with his
birthplace on’t, though Josiah demurred.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I always thought you wuz so peticular,
Samantha, what you eat on, and the idee of eatin’
on Shakespeare&mdash;cow-slop greens, for instance, or
pork and beans.”</p>

<p>I sez, “It hain’t Shakespeare’s face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>“Wall, eatin’ cabbage and onions on a meetin’-house.”</p>

<p>“It is <i>his</i> house,” sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “custard and Shakespeare’s
birthplace.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “what of it&mdash;what of custard and
Shakespeare?” My tone wuz cold&mdash;cold as ice,
and it danted him, and he sez&mdash;“Oh, wall, if you
can reconcile ’em, and bring ’em together, buy
it.”</p>

<p>It wuz the money he begreched, though you
could git ’em from a sixpence up. I gin a shillin’
for mine. It wuz a good plate.</p>

<p>Wall, we went acrost the old bridge, over the
clear waters of the Avon. And we visited the
Memorial Hall, a big buildin’ built in honor of
the poet’s three hundredth anniversary. It has
a theatre to act out Shakespeare’s plays on
Memorial days, and a library filled with the volumes
that have been writ about him, and the
picter gallery is filled with picters, some on ’em
different faces of hisen, and them relatin’ to his
life and writin’s. It wuz a interestin’ spot, and I
would have loved to lingered in it longer, and so
would Alice and Al Faizi, but Josiah wuz tired out,
and he sed to me aside&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is most night and I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>am starved to death!”
Sez he, “I hain’t most starved, but starved.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “we shall have to do what Martin
sez.”</p>

<p>“Martin!” he whispered enough to take my
head off&mdash;“Martin! Can he suffer and die for me,
do you think?”</p>

<p>And then he reviled me for not havin’ some
cookies and cheese with me.</p>

<p>And I asked him if I could be expected to make a
restoraunt of myself, and lug round cookies and cheese
for him all over Europe. And we had some words.</p>

<p>But the expression of his face wuz pitiful in the
extreme when Martin come up, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Without doubt it would be expected of me to
visit Shottery and see Anne Hathaway’s cottage.
And as my time is limited, and I have already
wasted nearly a day of my valuable time in noticing
Shakespeare, I think that we had better do up the
whole of this weary job to-night; so I propose that
we go at once from here to Shottery.” And he
hurried out to the carriage.</p>

<p>Josiah whispered to me in a feeble voice, “He
needn’t use any Shottery on me or stabbery or any
other killery, I shall fall dead without ’em. I cannot
stand it, Samantha!” sez he.</p>

<p>He did indeed look wan; weariness and hunger
had made sad inroads on his mean, and my heart
melted, and I hurried out to see if I could <span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>gain
Martin’s consent to wait till mornin’ before we went.
But no! He said he knew that he should be asked
if he had seen the cottage, and he could not waste
another day on a writer of
books and the girl he married.</p>

<p>Alice come out jest then
a-lookin’ considerable pale, and
I sez, “It is goin’ to be pretty
hard on Alice and Adrian;
they are pretty tired now.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” sez he. That
man would have jumped into
the Avon if it would have
pleased either of ’em. He
worships ’em. And then he
sez, “I suppose I can stay
over another day.” Sez he,
“They are of the <i>first</i> importance.”</p>

<p>And the supper that man eat wuz so enormous
that I whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have I saved you, Josiah, to lose you now?
saved you on the road and relicks, to lose you on a

<p class="h2sub">SHOTTERY AND WARWICK CASTLE.</p>

<p>Wall, the next mornin’ we sot out bright and
early for Shottery, Josiah feelin’ as peart as you
please, and the two children’s faces lookin’ like
roses. Al Faizi’s eyes wuz bent on the biggest and
sweetest rose, as you may say, with a worshippin’
look, that nobody noticed but she who wuz once
Smith.</p>

<p>We found the cottage a long, low buildin’, lookin’
as old as the hills, though, like ’em, there didn’t seem
to be no signs of fallin’ down and decayin’.</p>

<p>They say it is in jest the condition it wuz when
gentle Anne Hathaway lived here, and drawed
William over here so often by the strong magnetism
of love.</p>

<p>The walls wuz kinder criss-crossed, lookin’ some
like Shakespeare’s cottage, and the ruff wuz kinder
histed up in places, down towards the eaves, into
gabriel ends. And some birds wuz playin’ and
wheelin’ round the chimblys. They might have
been to all appearance the very same birds that sang
round the latticed winders of Anne’s room, and
waked her up on summer mornin’s, a-sayin’ to her,
as they wheeled round and round it, in the rosy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
dawn&mdash;</p>

<p>“Will is coming to-day to see you! Will loves
you! Will loves you!”</p>

<p>I presoom the birds wuz relations to them very
ones&mdash;grandchildren, “removed” a great number
of times.</p>

<p>If birds keep a family tree and plume themselves
on their ancestors (and trees and plumes comes
nateral to ’em), I presoom they talk this over
amongst themselves; mebby that wuz jest what they
wuz a-talkin’ about that day, a-twitterin’ about
legends a-flyin’ down from the past&mdash;</p>

<p>How the happy, eager-faced lover ust to come
to see their pretty Anne, and how her heart wuz
won, and she went out of the old house a happy
bride with the man of her heart, who wuz not an
illustrious man to her at all, but only Will, Will
Shakespeare, the man she loved, and who loved her.</p>

<p>How they did chirp and talk sunthin’ over! I d’no
what it wuz.</p>

<p>Inside wuz some old-fashioned furniture, amongst
the rest a bed that ust to belong to Miss Shakespeare,
she that wuz Anne Hathaway. Mebby it wuz
the same bedstead that her pardner left her in his
will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>“His second-best bed and bed furniture.”</p>

<p>It seems as if he hadn’t ort to done it; it seems
as if she ort to had the best one. Howsumever,
there might be reasons that I don’t know nothin’ of
that influenced him. Mebby they’d had words over
it; mebby she’d told him that she wouldn’t take it
as a gift, and that he needn’t give it to her; mebby
she thought it wuz extravagant in him to buy it,
and throwed it in his face that as much as he paid
for it, it wuz nothin’ but hens’ feathers, and the
second-best bed, the one her ma had gin her, wuz as
good agin and softer layin’.</p>

<p>I d’no, nor nobody don’t. Anyway, he willed it
to her, and I presoom it wuz on this very bedstead
it wuz put; it gin me queer emotions to look on’t,
and a sight on ’em.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin sed that as the day wuz partially
wasted, we might jest as well drive over and see
Warwick Castle; it wuz only eight milds’ drive.</p>

<p>The old town of Warwick is about eighteen
hundred years old, and dates back to the time of
the Romans.</p>

<p>But, as Martin well sed, “Think of a town over
eighteen hundred years old with only ten thousand
inhabitants, and then,” sez he, a-leanin’ back in the
carriage and puttin’ his thumbs in his vest pockets
a-pityin’ and a-patronizin’ the Old World dretfully&mdash;</p>

<p>“Think of Chicago, about fifty years old and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
with a population of about forty hundred thousand”&mdash;he
spread out the population a purpose. He owns
lots of real estate in Chicago, and is always a-puffin’
it up.</p>

<p>Sez he, “They haven’t got public enterprise and
push over here, as we have.”</p>

<p>But his tone kinder grated on my nerve somehow,
and I spoke up and sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“They don’t base their reputation on a mob of
folks, and beef and pork; they have sunthin’ more
solider and more riz up like.”</p>

<p>But I’ll be hanged if I didn’t have to change
my mind a little afterwards, of which more
anon.</p>

<p>You see I had heard Thomas J. read a sight
about the old Saxon earls of Warwick, and specially
Guy Warwick in the time of Alfred the Great (you
know the man that fried them pancakes and burnt
’em, and had other great reverses, but come out
right in the end, as men always do who are willin’
to help wimmen in their housework).</p>

<p>I always bore strong on this great moral when
Thomas J. would be a-readin’ these deeds to me (I
thought he might jest as well wipe a few dishes for
me once in a while as well as not). And he’d read
“how Guy killed a Saxon giant nine feet tall, and a
wild boar, and a green dragon, and killed an enormous
cow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>At the porter’s lodge we see the rib of that cow,
and Josiah said, “You sed that they didn’t date
back any of their greatness to beef; what do you
call this? Why,” sez he, “Ury and I kill a cow
almost every fall; nothin’ is said in history of it;
you don’t set any more store by me.”</p>

<p>I see that I had done the man onjestice, and I
sez tenderly, “You are a good provider of beef,
Josiah, and always have been; but,” sez I, “this
cow wuz probble twice the size of one of your
Jerseys. You couldn’t wear that breastplate, or
swing that great tiltin’-pole, or the enormous sword
that hangs up there,” sez I, “you couldn’t move
’em hardly with both hands, and,” sez I, “look at
that immense porridge-pot of hisen; you couldn’t
eat that full of porridge, as he probble did.”</p>

<div class="figright illowp92" id="i_359" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_359.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">You couldn’t eat that full of porridge.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Try me!” sez he, earnestly&mdash;“jest try me, that’s
all.” Sez he, “I could eat every spunful and ask for
more.”</p>

<p>And there it wuzn’t much after noon. That
man’s appetite is a wonder to me and has been ever
sence I took it in charge. And foreign travel,
which I thought mebby would kind o’ quell it down,
only seems to whet it up to a sharper edge.</p>

<p>The way to the castle is through a large gateway,
and then we go through a roadway which is cut
through solid rock for more’n a hundred feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
and then when you come out, you suddenly git a
full view of the grand old castle, with its strong
walls and noble old Round towers.</p>

<p>The first is Guy’s Tower, one hundred and twenty-eight
feet high, and has walls ten feet thick&mdash;jest
think on’t! the walls further
acrost than our best bedroom.</p>

<p>Then there is Cæsar’s Tower,
eight hundred years old and one
hundred and fifty feet high, and
between these towers the gray,
strong old castle walls, with slits
in ’em for the bowmen to shoot
their arrers out of, and portcullises
and old moat, showin’
that the castle in its young days
had everything for its comfort and defence. Enterin’
one of the arched gateways in the wall, you
find yourself on the velvet grass and amongst the
stately old trees of a spacious courtyard, with the
ivy-covered walls and towers and battlements risin’
on every side of it.</p>

<p>We walked round up on them walls&mdash;clumb up
into Guy’s Tower and looked off on a glorious landscape,
as beautiful as any picter, and went down
below Cæsar’s Tower into some dungeons; gloomy
places of sorrer, filled even now with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span> atmosphere
of pain and agonized memories.</p>

<p>The great hall, sixty-two feet by forty, with oak
ceilin’ and walls darkened by time and covered with
carvin’s, has firearms of all kinds, and splendid
armor of all ages&mdash;English crossbows, wicked-lookin’
Italian rapiers, weepons of all kinds inlaid
with gold and silver in the most elegant workmanship.</p>

<p>We see Prince Rupert’s armor, Cromwell’s helmet,
a gun from the battlefield of Marston Moor. And,
in fact, all round you you see the most elegant and
curous curosities, and can look down the hull
length of the grand apartments that open into each
other, a length of three hundred and thirty feet&mdash;the
red drawin’-room, the gilt drawin’-room, the
cedar drawin’-room, etc., etc.</p>

<p>At the end of a little hall leadin’ from the great
hall I see the noted picter of Charles 1st on horseback,
with one hand on his side.</p>

<p>I declare, it actually seemed as if he wuz a-goin’
to ride right in here amongst us, it wuz so perfectly
nateral. It wuz painted by Vandyke. I don’t see
how Vandyke ever done it&mdash;I couldn’t.</p>

<p>The apartments are all furnished beautiful&mdash;beautiful.
Cabinets, bronzes, exquisite old china, magnificent
anteek furniture, and the most rare and
beautiful picters are on every side&mdash;by Rubens, Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
Peter Lely, Hans Holbein, Salvator Rosa, Rembrandt,
Vandyke, Guido, Andrea del Sarto, Teniers,
Murillo, Paul Veronese. And beautiful marble
busts by Chantrey, Powers, etc. There wuz a lovely
table that once wuz owned by Marie Antoinette.
And others had rarest vases on ’em, and wonderful
enamelled work of glass and china, with raised figgers
on ’em, made by floatin’ the metals in glass;
nobody in the world knows now how to make ’em.
One dish we see wuz worth one thousand pounds.</p>

<p>As I see this I nudged Josiah, and sez I, “When
you think of what this dish is worth, hain’t you
ashamed of standin’ out about that plate?” And
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“It wuz the sperit of the thing I looked at,
mixin’ Shakespeare up with vittles; though,” sez he,
“I would gladly eat now offen a angel or a seraphin;
why,” sez he, “St. Peter himself wouldn’t dant me.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “we’ll be havin’ dinner before
long.” We laid out to eat at Warwick before we
went back.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Look round you and let your soul grow
by takin’ in these noble sights.” Sez I, “Look at
them bronzes and tortoise-shell and ivory and
mosaic.”</p>

<p>Sez he, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>“I’d swop the hull lot of ’em, if they belonged
to me, for a plate of nut cakes or a bologna
sassige. And I’d ruther see a good platter of pork
and beans than the hull on ’em!”</p>

<p>I knew he wouldn’t complain so much alone, so
I left him and sauntered round
to look at the beautiful objects
on every side.</p>

<p>In the state bedroom is the
bed that belonged to Queen
Anne, and the table and trunks
that she used, also her picter.</p>

<p>In the grand dinin’ hall is a
great sideboard, made from a
oak that grew on the Kenilworth
estate, so old that they
spoze it wuz standin’ when
Queen Elizabeth come here to
the castle a-visitin’.</p>

<p>The carvin’s on it show the
comin’ of Queen Elizabeth
and her train, her meetin’ with sweet Amy Robsart
in the grotto, the queen’s meetin’ with Leicester,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Jest as I wuz a-lookin’ at this and a-standin’ before
it in deep thought, Martin come on out of
the drawin’-room, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“A wonderful display of art and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span> virtu!” sez he.</p>

<p>My eye wuz bent on that sideboard, and I
sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“I d’no as I’d call it a display of virtue&mdash;I don’t
believe I would.”</p>

<p>I wuz sorry for Miss Leicester&mdash;sorry as a dog.</p>

<p>Though when I see the epitaph she put above
that handsome, fascinatin’ mean creeter (her husband),
put it over him her own self, when he wuzn’t
by her to skair her and make her stand up for him
as pardners will sometimes&mdash;I d’no as I wuz very
sorry for her. Thinkses I, She either didn’t know
enough to know what her pardner wuz up to, or else
she wuz sech a fool she didn’t care about it. In either
case I felt that my sympathy wuz wasted&mdash;of which
epitaph more anon.</p>

<p>Wall, we went through a place in the wall they
called a portcullis, and over a bridge called a
moat.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp65" id="i_362" style="max-width: 15em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">The more I see of moats, the more determined
 I be to have one round our house.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>And Josiah nudged me here, and sez he, “The
more I see of moats, the more determined I be to
have one round our house.” Sez he, “How stylish
it would be and how handy! When you see company
comin’ you didn’t want, or peddlers or agents
or anything, jest pull back your drawbridge, and
there you’d be safe and sound.” Sez he, “I’ve
wanted one for years, and now I’m bound on havin’
one.” Sez he, “Ury and I will start one the minute
I git home.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You won’t do any sech thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, a-arguin’, “it would be a boon to
you, Samantha; hain’t I hearn you groan when onexpected
company driv up, and you wuz out of
cookin’ or cleanin’ house or anything? All you’d
have to do would be jest to speak to Ury or me, and
jest as they wuz a-comin’ along, a-thinkin’ of dinner
mebby, a-wonderin’ what you’d have&mdash;bang! would
go the drawbridge, and they’d jest have to back up,
and turn round and go home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I; “how could I face ’em the next
Sunday in meetin’? It hain’t feasible,” sez I.</p>

<p>“Face ’em?” sez he; “if they said anything, tell
’em to start a moat of their own; tell ’em you
couldn’t keep house without one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shaw!” sez I; “come and look at this
vase.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, we had entered a greenhouse full of
the most beautiful flowers and rare plants, and wuz
even then in front of the famous Warwick vase.
It is a huge, round, white marble vase that holds
one hundred and thirty-six gallons, with clusters of
grapes and leaves and tendrils; and vine branches,
exquisitely wrought, run round the top and form
the two large handles, with other designs full of
grace and beauty all wrought in it. How old this
vase is nobody knows, but it wuz used by somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
probbly centuries before old Warwick Castle wuz
ever thought on.</p>

<p>Who wuz it that drinked out of it? How did
they look? How come it sunk in the bottom of
the lake? I d’no, nor Josiah don’t.</p>

<p>It wuz found at the bottom of a lake near Tivoli
by Sir William Hamilton, Ambassador then at the
court of Naples.</p>

<p>I gazed pensively on the vine-clad spear of
Mr. Bacchus carved on it, and sez I to Josiah&mdash;</p>

<p>“How true it is that that sharp spear that Mr.
Bacchus brandishes is covered with beautiful vines
and flowers at first; but it stabs,” sez I&mdash;“it stabs
hard, and,” sez I, “who knows but somebody that
had been pierced to the heart by that spear of hisen,
a-reachin’ ’em mebby through the ruined life of
some loved one&mdash;who knows but what he got so
sick of seein’ them symbols of drinkin’ revels that
he jest pitched it into the lake?”</p>

<p>“Keep on!” sez Josiah, “keep on! I believe
you’d keep up your dum temperance talk if you
wuz on the way to the scaffold.”</p>

<p>“That would be the time to preach it,” sez I;
“scaffolds is jest what drinkin’ revels lead to, and
if it wuz my last words, mebby folks would pay
some attention to what I said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>“Wall, wait till then,” sez he. “I have got to
have a little rest. I am dyin’ for a little food, and
if I git through this day alive I have got to be
careful, and let my <i>ears</i> rest anyway.”</p>

<p>He did indeed look quite bad, and I sez soothin’ly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, Martin will be for goin’ back before long
now. He is gittin’ hungry himself; I heard him
say so.”</p>

<p>We didn’t stop to but one more place on our
way back to the tarvern where we had dinner, and
that wuz to that old horsepital founded by Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in 1571. It wuz meant
in the first place for one Master and twelve bretheren,
the bretheren to be of the Earl’s servants, or
his soldiers who had been injured in battle. But
now they are appointed from Warwick and
Gloucester, and have a comfortable livin’.</p>

<p>It wuz quite likely in Robert to build this horsepital&mdash;a
old-fashioned-lookin’ place enough in 1895.
But sech likely deeds as this couldn’t cover up his
black performances.</p>

<p>The chapel is an elegant buildin’, built for a
memorial to the great Earl of Warwick, the first in
the Norman line, and his elaborate tomb is here.</p>

<p>But it wuz in this chapel where I see the epitaph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
of which I spoke more formerly. It is over the
tomb of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the one
Queen Elizabeth thought so much on. There I
see the epitaph I despised.</p>

<p>On the tomb are the recumbent figgers of
Leicester and his pardner, the Countess Lettice.
Probbly about the only time they wuz ever so
nigh to each other without quarrellin’, and this
epitaph sez, after givin’ all his titles&mdash;more’n enough
of ’em&mdash;</p>

<p>“His most sorrowful wife Letitia, through a
sense of conjugal love and fidelity, has put up this
monument to the <i>best</i> and <i>dearest</i> of husbands.”</p>

<p>She must have been a <i>fool</i>, for besides his goin’s
on with the queen&mdash;which would made me as
jealous as a dog&mdash;a learned writer says&mdash;</p>

<p>“According to every appearance of probability,
he poisoned his first wife, disowned his second, dishonored
his third before he married her, and in
order to marry her, murdered her first husband,
while his only surviving son was a natural child by
Lady Sheffield.”</p>

<p>“The <i>best</i> of husbands!” What wuz Lettice
a-thinkin’ on? She’d no need to put his actin’s and
cuttin’s up on a tombstun. I wouldn’t advised
her to; but I should say to her&mdash;“Now, Lettice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>you jest put onto that gravestun a good, plain
Bible verse&mdash;‘The Lord be merciful to me, a sinner,’
or, ‘Now the weary are at rest,’” or sunthin’
like that&mdash;I should have convinced her. But, then,
I wuzn’t there&mdash;I wuz born a few hundred years too
late, and so it had to be; but it made me feel bad
to see it. I want my sect to have a little self-respect.</p>

<p>Al Faizi is dretful well-read in history, and he
took out that little book of hisen, and copied off
the hull of the inscription on Leicester’s tomb, all
the glowin’ eulogy of his glorious deeds, which he
knew wuz false. He didn’t say nothin’, as usual,
but looked quite a good deal as he writ.</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’ to him, but Josiah will att
him once in a while about his writin’, and he sez
now&mdash;</p>

<p>“What are you a-writin’ about, Fazer?”</p>

<p>He turned his dreamy, pleasant eyes onto us,
and seemed to be lookin’ some distance through
us and beyend us, and the light from the East
winder fell warm on his face as he sez evasively&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your missionaries tell our people to always
tell the truth&mdash;that we will be lost if we do not.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez Josiah, “that is true.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi didn’t reply to him, but kep’ on
a-writin’.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>
<p>Wall, a happy man wuz my pardner as we returned
to the tarvern, and a good, refreshin’ meal
of vittles wuz spread before him. He done jestice
to it&mdash;full jestice&mdash;yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Wall, the next mornin’ we sot out for the Lake
Deestrict, accordin’ to Martin’s first plan, which
he’d changed some. Sez Martin, as we wuz talkin’
it over that evenin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“It would, perhaps, be expected of me to go
on and visit Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I warmly, “Thomas J. has read so
much to me about Tom Brown at Oxford, it
would be highly interestin’ to see the places Tom
thought so much on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Alice with enthoosiasm, “and where
Richard the Lion-hearted was born, and where
Alfred the Great lived.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “I wouldn’t give a cent to see where
he lived. I despise fryin’ flap-jacks, and always did,
and if a man undertakes to fry ’em, he ort to tend to
’em and not let ’em burn.”</p>

<p>But Alice went right on, “And think of being
in the place which William the Conqueror invaded!”</p>

<p>“And,” sez Al Faizi, “where Latimer, and Ridley,
and Cranmer were burned at the stake for
their religion by Bloody Mary.”</p>

<p>It beat all how well-read that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>heathen is&mdash;he
knows more than the schoolmaster at Jonesville,
enough sight.</p>

<p>But sez Martin, with his thumbs inside of them
armholes of hisen&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is not for any
such trifling reasons that
I would visit Oxford,
but, as I say, it undoubtedly
would be expected
of me, if it was
known at Oxford that I
was so near, that I would
give a little of my valuable
time to them; for
there, I have thought
hard of sending my son
to finish his education.</p>

<p>“For as you know,
Cousin Samantha, my
boy is to have the best
and costliest education that money can give.
His future is in the hands of one who will look
out sharply for the very best and most valuable
means of education. It is not as if he were
a common child. But he is my little Partner&mdash;are
you not, Adrian?” sez he fondly to the little
boy, who wuz lookin’ dreamily out of the winder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span></p>
<p>Adrian turned, and the gold of the settin’ sun
wuz on his sweet face.</p>

<p>“Your father will look out for your future, little
Partner; we will work together for your good, will
we not, my boy?”</p>

<p>Mebby it wuz because I sot there so nigh&mdash;mebby
it wuz the perfume of the English voyalets Alice
had pinned into the front of my bask, jest like
’em I wore that day, but, anyway, some recollection
seemed to take him back to that time at Jonesville,
for he sez, jest as he did then&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft illowp70" id="i_370" style="max-width: 15em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">I am going to work for the poor.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I am going to work for the poor.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!” sez Martin, smilin’, “and how
will you do it, little Partner?”</p>

<p>Agin he turned his sweet face towards us, and
agin the big, earnest eyes and sweet, serious mouth
wuz gilded by the glowin’, yet sad smile of the
sinkin’ sun.</p>

<p>And he sez simply, “I don’t quite know how,
Father, but I know I shall work for them, and help
them in some way.”</p>

<p>Wall, Martin dismissed the matter with a laugh,
but I kep’ the words in my heart, and believed ’em.
I believed truly that the Lord would lead him, and
make him do His work.</p>

<p>Wall, I kinder wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span> to visit Mugby Junction,
as Dickens named Rugby Junction. It wuzn’t fur
from Warwick, and I’d loved to seen it, and eat one
of them sandwitches, and been glared at by the
female in charge there, and her help, and seen her
poor, browbeat husband and the <i>Boy</i>, but didn’t
know as they wuz all alive.</p>

<p>And if they wuz, as Josiah well sed, sez he, “My
stumick is bad enough now, without eatin’ leather
sandwitches.”</p>

<p>And I sez, “I’d love to give ’em my recipe for
good yeast bread, and I’d willin’ly tell ’em how to
make delicious sandwitches, and not ask a cent for
it.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Take good minced chicken, or lamb, and
a little mustard and sweet butter, and a pinch of
minced onions and&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Josiah interrupted me, “They’d only look
stunily at you if you offered your services; why,”
sez he, “they always look as if they feel so much
above you at our railroad stations to home, that you
want to crawl into your hand-bag and git out of
their way. They’d despise your overtoors.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “my conscience would be clear,
and travellers’ nightmairs wouldn’t be so frequent.”</p>

<p>But a bystander observed that they had good
sandwitches there now.</p>

<p>Havin’ been turned round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span> in their stuny and
leather course, by Dickens, I spoze.</p>

<p>So we packed up our things and started in pretty
good sperits for the Lake Deestrict.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE LAKE DISTRICT AND ITS POETS.</p>

<p>We went to Windermere, and from there took
the omnibus for Bowness&mdash;</p>

<p>One of the charmin’est little villages I ever sot
my eyes on, as clean as my kitchen is when I git
it all swept out. The housen are all built of stun,
and some on ’em have little porches built out on
’em, but all on ’em overrun with ivy. And flowers
and pretty climbin’ plants make every house attractive,
and not a mite of dust or dirt&mdash;I wonder
what they do with it?</p>

<p>The little tarvern where we stayed wuz so clean
and comfortable that I wondered what the tarvern-keeper
and his wife would say if they wuz sot down
in some of our own small hotels. It wuz a lesson
in perfect neatness and order, the hull place wuz.</p>

<p>And the landscapes all round the little village
wuz pretty enough to frame, and we see ’em more
or less all the while we stayed there; we made our
headquarters there, and sallied out for excursions,
a-lookin’ on picters on every side on us&mdash;green
grass and foliage, high, tree-covered hills, little,
lovely, clean, picturesque villages like them I have
described, magnificent country seats, with grand entrances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
and porters’ lodges, and stately green parks,
and fountains, and deers, and sleek herds of cattle
walkin’ through on the velvet grass and green tree
aisles, and cottages, and quaint old bridges, and
dark stun churches half covered with ivy.</p>

<p>Bowness is on the shores of the lake. As I say,
we put up at a good tarvern, and the next day we
sot out on our sight-seein’.</p>

<p>The waiter at the tarvern told us as we sot out on
our first excursion that we had better take our
waterproofs and umbrells.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that I had my faithful umbrell
in my hand, but the rest hadn’t, so they got
theirn, and I went back for my waterproof, and
glad enough we wuz, for before night we wuz
ketched out in four different showers&mdash;good drivin’
ones, but short.</p>

<p>Martin, who had been ust to fur bigger lakes&mdash;Michigan,
Ontario, Superior, and sech&mdash;wuz bitterly
dissapinted in ’em, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“A trout out of Lake Superior would die of
thirst in one of these lakes.”</p>

<p>And Josiah, who had been up on our lakes on
a tower, sed that those lakes would make a pretty
good waterin’ trough for American cattle; sez he,
“There would be in each one of ’em as much as an
ordinary Yankee cow would want to drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>I see the driver a-lookin’ on in deep surprise, and
sez I, “Josiah Allen, remember you are a deacon;
let it be known to once that you are talkin’ in
parables.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I would want to be took in that
way, but they’re dum small potatoes compared to
our lakes.”</p>

<p>“But they’re beautiful,” sez I, “and are full of
tender associations.” Sez I, “Look at the poets that
have hallowed these sacred spots&mdash;Coleridge, and
Southey, and Wordsworth, and Mrs. Hemans,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez Josiah, interruptin’ me, “on our
lakes there is me, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I turned away in silent scorn, and looked
out on the beauty of the seen. Lovely picters
lay round us on every side&mdash;wooded shores, lovely
islands, glowin’ waters&mdash;a paneramy of beauty
never to be forgot.</p>

<p>Dove’s Nest, which wuz once the home of
Mrs. Hemans, I looked on with a deep interest,
for though Felishy and I didn’t think alike about
little Casey Bianky, who “stood on the burnin’
deck,” and I should have approved of his runnin’
away before he got burnt up, still I respected her
for quite a number of things, and as I meditated
on the poets who had loved this beautiful place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
and lived here and wrote their songs, I instinctively
thought, in the words of Felishy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where are these dreamers now?”</p>
</div>

<p>The biggest of these lakes are Windermere,
Ullswater, Conoston and Durwentwater, but there
are a good many others. And they are all, like our
Niagara Falls and Thousand Islands, been turned
into money-makin’ shows.</p>

<p>Wall, of course we wanted to see&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How the waters come down to Lodore.”</p>
</div>

<p>But we wuz dretful dissapinted, for the water
didn’t come a-sweepin’ down with the force and
fury Mr. Southey described&mdash;not at all. Josiah,
who had hearn Thomas J. read the poem, wuz mad
to think it wuzn’t so. “And,” sez he, in a threatenin’
way&mdash;</p>

<p>“I could tell Mr. Southey that we didn’t know
none the better for <i>his</i> tellin’ ‘How the waters
come down to Lodore.’</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “the mill-dam to our buzz-saw
mill in Jonesville is furious agin as this, and more
noble and impressin’ lookin’ by fur, and,” sez he,
gettin’ all het up, “I’d love to tell Mr. Southey
so.”</p>

<p>Sez <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>I, “Josiah, don’t git nerved up and talk about
jawin’ a man who has been dead for more’n fifty
years.” Sez I, “It don’t sound decent in you&mdash;he
meant well.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “He wuz good to his own family, and
then think of how dretful good he wuz to Coleridge’s
wife and children; though, to be sure,” sez I,
“they wuz relations on <i>Her</i> side.”</p>

<p>“I understand that,” sez Josiah; “he could do
<i>that</i> and not deserve any particular thanks to <i>himself</i>.
I know how <i>that</i> is.”</p>

<p>I see he wuz insinuatin’ sunthin’ or ruther, but I
wuzn’t browbeat, nor wuzn’t led off by him.
Sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“He writ first-rate prose, and wuz Poet Lauerate.</p>

<p>“That wuz what might be expected,” sez Josiah.</p>

<p>I don’t exactly know what he did mean by that,
and I don’t believe he did.</p>

<p>“Then,” sez I, “he wuz the greatest talker that
ever talked. He would talk for hours and hours,
without gittin’ up, or those gittin’ up that heard
him.”</p>

<p>“I know what that is,” sez Josiah; “that don’t
raise him in my estimation; no, Heaven knows
it don’t!”</p>

<p>I hain’t the <i>least</i> idee what he meant by <i>that</i>, but
he found immegiately that I wouldn’t multiply any
more words with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p>But, as I sez, it wuz a comfort to visit this hant of
Southey, and I wuzn’t goin’ to see him run down
too much for enlargin’ a little mite about the power
of that waterfall; as I sez to Josiah&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sunthin’ ort to be allowed for a poet’s license.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is so; I didn’t
think of it,” sez he. “I thought
it wuz a barefaced lie. I see,”
sez he; “I make use of one of
them poet’s licenses myself
sometimes; I forgot.”</p>

<p>Wall, the waters did meander
down in a very languishin’
and thin sort of a way, and I
couldn’t deny it, but the surroundin’s
wuz beautiful and
the associations hantin’ and
powerful in the extreme.</p>

<p>Wall, while we wuz in that neighborhood I see
everything I could of the remains of the Lake
School of Poets. I told Josiah I wanted to, and he
sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, I d’no as I’m a-goin’ to make much of a
effort to see their hants.” Sez he, “Probble they
got that name, Lake Poet, because their poetry
hain’t no bigger accordin’ than the lakes be, and if
that is so, I don’t want to patronize ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>“Patronize!” sez I, lookin’ several icy cold
daggers through him. “I have to stand Martin’s
demeanors and acts, though they are harrowin’ to
my soul and sickenin’ to the stumick, but I <i>won’t</i>
stand by and have my own pardner talk about
patronizin’ Coleridge and Wordsworth.” Sez I,
“Talk about patronizin’ the man that wrote ‘The
Ancient Mariner.’”</p>

off some distance away. And my mind roamed on
that weird and matchless poem I had heard Thomas
J. read so much, that I wuz as familiar with as I
wuz with the Almanac.</p>

<p>How the Ancient Mariner&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Held the wedding guests with his glittering eye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And how that belated guest “beat his breast”
as he heard the weddin’ guests pass in, and he havin’
to set out on a stun by the side of the road, and
<i>had</i> to hear this “gray beard loon” tell his story.
For the old Mariner knew the one he had to tell it
to when the fit come on, and so that weddin’ guest
had to set and hear that most weird and wonderful
story ever told.</p>

<p>And at last, jest as he released that poor, tuckered-out
guest (when the weddin’ wuz all over, poor dissapinted
creeter!), how he ended with these lines, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
noble they must have mollified that poor, belated
creeter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He prayeth best, who loveth best</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All things, both great and small,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the dear God, who loveth us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He made and loveth all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then there is the poem of Christabel,
another one of my very primest favorites. How
many times the truth of some of them lines have
been brung up to me in my own native land of
Jonesville!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas! they had been friends in youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But whispering tongues can poison truth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Alas! for the whisperin’ tongues that carry the
poison of asps with them. Alas! for the hearts and
lives that through their malice and whisperin’s are
torn apart, and nothin’ can atone for their evil
effects&mdash;nothin’, <i>nothin’</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Can free the hollow hearts from paining,</div>

<p>Yes; my mind jest dwelt on Mr. Coleridge all
the time while I wuz in the Lake Deestrict. But we
see while we wuz there lots of other places of great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>interest to me. Though, as I sed, the Falls of
Lodore didn’t fall quite so much as he had depictered
’em, yet Rydal Falls wuz a seen of beauty
and enchantment, with the water flowin’ down
through the rocks and overhangin’ trees. It wuz
a picter to always remember, to frame round with
admiration and hang up in your memory.</p>

<p>And then there wuz a promontory called Storr’s
Point, which had a observatory built on it. Here
wuz where Sir Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Southey,
and Conway met in 1825 to see a regatta gin in
Scott’s honor.</p>

<p>It must have been a pretty sight, the scenery
around it wuz so beautiful.</p>

<p>And then we see Miss Martineau’s handsome
residence, called the Knolls. I spoze on account
of its being built on quite a rise of ground.</p>

<p>I spoze she wuz quite a likely poetess, and
wrote most probble twenty books on every subject,
from religion and politics to mesmerism and
handicraft. But Thomas Jefferson couldn’t never
git over sunthin’ she said to Charlotte Brontë in a
kind of a fault-findin’ way; it jest gaulded Charlotte
dretfully. Poor little creeter! with the mind of a
giant and the body of a child&mdash;a glowin’ soul of
fire and the shrinkin’ weakness and tenderness of
heart of a young child.</p>

<p>Harriet hadn’t ort to said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span> it&mdash;she ort to known
that God don’t send a genius any too often onto
this dull earth, and folks ort to prize ’em and guard
’em when He duz; but folks don’t; they pick at
’em, and they have to stan’ it, and build up a stun
wall of endurance and constant anguish of patience
between these tormentors and their own souls and
sensitive feelin’s. And then set behind that barricade
and try to write. And folks only see the stun
work, and don’t see what it wuz raised for, and they
call ’em cold, and cross, and unfeelin’, and etc., etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>But they hain’t cold, nor etc., etc., etc.&mdash;no sech
thing.</p>

<p>But I am a-eppisodin’, and to resoom.</p>

<p>I presoom that one thing that made Harriet sour
and kinder hard sometimes wuz she wuz so deef;
not a-knowin’ any of the time what other wimmen
wuz a-sayin’ about her&mdash;behind her back, or
to her face either; it’s enough to sour any disposition,
only the very sweetest ones.</p>

<p>Wall, we went to Hawkeshead, where Wordsworth
went to school, Martin sayin’ he should
probble be asked if he had seen the old school-house.</p>

<p>It wuz a old schoolhouse a hundred years ago,
when Wordsworth went to school there.</p>

<p>It is a little, old-fashioned place, and Martin put
his fingers in his vest pockets, and leaned back, and
looked round him some as if he wuz a-patronizin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
them old memories with which the place wuz
filled.</p>

<p>Good land! he’d no need to; them memories
towered up and filled the hull place, and floated off
round it into the serene, beautiful
English landscape, and up towards
the blue heavens above.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp49" id="i_384" style="max-width: 15em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>Martin with his patronizin’ ways.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Martin couldn’t quell ’em down
with his leanin’s back, and thumbs in
his armholes, and patronizin’ ways.</p>

<p>I sot down to the poor, shabby
old bench to which he had sot, and
see the very spot where the boy Billy
had cut his name in the rough old
desk. Mebby he got licked for it&mdash;I
shouldn’t wonder a mite. The
teacher not knowin’ that though he
might be slapped in youth, and laughed
at by Reviewers in early manhood, yet a great man&mdash;a
man of simple manners, and a soul of genius
sot there at that desk, jest as the great oak wuz hid
in the heart of the acorn in Billy’s pocket, mebby,
at the time.</p>

<p>I had quite a large number of emotions as I sot
there&mdash;probble upwards of seventy-five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span></p>

<p>Wall, of course we went to Rydal Mount, the
home where he lived and worked, and to Grass-mere,
where he lays asleep with his kindred.</p>

<p>The south wind waved the branches of the trees
that stood jest a little ways from the simple slabs.</p>

<p>Not fur off wuz the grave of Hartley Coleridge,
son of Wordsworth’s friend&mdash;a son who inherited
all the splendor and weakness of his father’s nater.</p>

<p>He drinked!</p>

<p>But some of his sonnets are upliftin’ in the extreme.</p>

<p>“Poor creeter! what he could have been if he
had left stimulants alone,” I sez to my pardner, as
we looked down on his quiet grave.</p>

<p>And he sez, “There you be agin&mdash;meetin’-housen
and castles can’t stop you, nor buryin’-grounds
skair you out; I’m sick of your dum W. C. T. U.
talk!”</p>

<p>I felt too riz up to argy with him, but I felt
deeply the truth of what whiskey had done in his
case. And as to his pa, I said to myself, “Weakness
of will, and opium, mebby, stood in the way
of the world’s seein’ another Shakespeare&mdash;not <i>jest</i>
like him, but a new and uneek type of poet; jest
as great and dazzlin’, but different as one big star
differs from another&mdash;all on ’em a-flashin’ out light
onto a dark, dull world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>
<p>Alice felt deeply the sweet sadness of the spot&mdash;the
quiet beauty of the landscape round us, the
bird’s song in the green branches overhead, and the
low, sweet song of the
little stream, the south
wind amongst the trees.</p>

<p>She stood under a
tree lookin’ up through
it into the sky overhead,
followin’ the flight of a
bird. Her face looked
so sweet&mdash;so sweet that
I thought if Wordsworth
was here he
would be reminded of
his own lines, and think
that&mdash;</p>

<p>Al Faizi felt this, I see&mdash;I could see that by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>

<p class="h2sub">THE ARRIVAL IN LONDON.</p>

<p>Martin, who owned, or pretty nigh owned, several
railroads, wuz dretful talkative about the superior
merits of our cars, etc. And, to tell the truth,
these English cars did seem quite a good deal like
ridin’ in a wagon, or a old-fashioned coach, where
you set facin’ each other, and they wuz pretty low,
made so as to not bump our heads when goin’
through covered bridges, I guess.</p>

<p>Of course, Martin paid for the best there wuz,
and we had a hull car to ourselves, all cushioned and
fixed off in the nicest manner, and after we all got
in we felt very comfortable all alone by ourselves if
we’d wanted to. And ever and anon a basket of
good refreshments to refresh ourselves would be
handed in to us. But it filled me with horrow to see
bottles of beer, wine, etc., in every one of ’em, and I
sez to myself&mdash;“Who and what did they spoze I
wuz?”</p>

<p>I wuz indignant to think that they should dast to
offer she that wuz once Samantha Smith bottles of
intoxicants.</p>

<p>Josiah kinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span> hefted the bottle in our basket,
and said dreamily sunthin’ about when you wuz in
Rome of doin’ as the Romans did. But I sez to
him coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be you a deacon or be you not? Are you a
member of the Temperance Society in Jonesville, or
are you not?”</p>

<p>And he kinder wriggled round oneasy in his seat
and laid the bottle down. If it hadn’t been for me,
I tremble to think what would have been the result
to Jonesville and the world at large.</p>

<p>Ever and anon the guide would walk along sideways
by our winder and go the hull length of the
train, for all I know a-seein’ to us. I don’t see what
hendered him from fallin’ off. It wuz sunthin’ I
wouldn’t have done for a dollar bill. I never wuz
any hand to walk sideways, even on the ground.</p>

<p>But, howsumever, there wuzn’t any casualties reported.</p>

<p>Another thing that did seem strange to us wuz
that we didn’t have any checks for our baggage to
take care on. That seems dretful queer to Americans
to have to go out and hunt round and find our
own trunks. Though we had no trouble with ourn,
for it wuz a very valuable one, and easy to be recognized
with the naked eye. It wuz a trunk that belonged
to Father Allen, and made on honor, and it
lasted him through his life, and then descended onto
Josiah&mdash;and will, we think, descend, as good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span> as new,
onto Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>One reason it has wore so well is, I spoze, that
Father Allen never took but one trip in his life
with it, and that wuz up to Canada. That journey
lasted him for a story all his days; he wuz looked
upon with considerable or as a highly travelled man.</p>

<p>The trunk is covered with hair of a good gray
color and trimmed off handsome with brass nails.
And Josiah, to make sure of its not bein’ stole,
writ our names in bright, brass-headed tacks. It
took him quite a spell. He sed he believed in
doin’ the fair thing by me, so it reads&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Josiah and Samantha Allen.<br />
Jonesville,<br />
U. S.</span>”
</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_391.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Them letters wuz a stroke of genius.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Them last letters he sed wuz a stroke of genius.
He sed the English
people would be so
tickled when they see
it, for they would see
in a minute that he and
me had really come
over! We wuz there!
“us!” Samantha and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
Josiah! and then, too, it would stand for the United
States.</p>

<p>He made them two letters of a little bigger nails, but
they wuz all good sized, and a very bright brass color.</p>

<p>And truly it did seem as if England wuz glad to
have us there, for I don’t remember of seein’ a single
Englishman that looked at that trunk that
didn’t laugh when he see it, or smile warmly. Yes,
they wuz glad enough to have us there.</p>

<p>Martin didn’t see the trunk until we arrove at the
steamer, and it affected him different. He looked
fairly stunted and browbeat when he sot his eyes
on it; evidently he thought it wuz a pity to run
the resk of jammin’ it, or gittin’ the nails rusty, for
sez he:</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! let me get you a new trunk!
It isn’t too late!” And he rushed off like a man half
distracted.</p>

<p>But it wuz too late, for the bell rung in a minute,
and we sot sail.</p>

<p>But Martin never see it durin’ that hull trip but
he looked on it with that same look of or&mdash;a kind
of a dark, questionin’ or.</p>

<p>Alice jest laughed when she see it. She liked its
looks, we could see, though she didn’t come right
out and say so.</p>

<p>But Adrian sed it wuz the most beautiful thing
he ever saw in his life. And he beset Josiah to
put his name on one of their trunks with the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
kind of nails.</p>

<p>And Josiah, who had took a few along to repair
damages in ourn, in case we should lose some of the
nails, or some envious Englishman should steal ’em
out, stood ready to do it.</p>

<p>But Martin broke it up. I guess he thought
that Adrian wuz too young to go into sech extravagances.
They had four trunks between ’em, but
not so much luggage as the English carry round
with ’em. They beat all, baskets, bundles, portmantys&mdash;as
they call their trunks&mdash;and hat-boxes and
rugs and bath-tubs.</p>

<p>The idee! What would we be thought on in
America if we lugged round sech things. Josiah,
who always hankers after style, sed he was most
sorry we didn’t take our enamelled wash-dish. Sez
he, “It would have looked dretful genteel;” sez he,
“We could have lashed it to our trunk with some
red cord, and it would have looked so stylish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shaw!” sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “when you’re in Rome, do as
the Romans do, and,” sez he, “I’d love to let the
English that carry round their bath-tubs see that
‘U. S.,’ the ones that own that trunk, know what
gentility is and what style is.”</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t gin in to the idee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span> though he as
good as sed that he stood ready to buy a new wash-dish
for the venter.</p>

<p>But economy prevailed, not common sense, but
jest closeness. I see in his mean that he wuz givin’
up the idee, as I told him that with the care I
would give it the wash-dish we had would last for
years and years.</p>

<p>Wall, we got to London in what ort to be the
daytime, but it wuz as dark as pitch with fog, and
how we wuz ever goin’ to git through them streets,
full of blackness and roar, roar and blackness, wuz
more’n I could tell.</p>

<p>I leaned back in that omnibus time and agin
durin’ that trip, truly feelin’ that my hour had come.</p>

<p>As Josiah told me afterwards, in talkin’ it over&mdash;I
wuz a-dwellin’ on my feelin’s durin’ the epock,
and he wanted to outdo me, I guess, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know jest how you felt, Samantha; I too
felt, in the words of another, as if ‘every breath I
drawed would be my next.’”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You meant your last.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “my last; it wuz a dretful time.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “I put my trust in Providence&mdash;a
good deal of the time I did.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “so did I. I wuz jest ground
down to it that I had to.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “less be thankful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span> that we got out
alive&mdash;out of that black, movin’, rumblin’ roar.”</p>

<p>We wuz talkin’ it over in our room that night,
a good, comfortable room, with all the modern improvements.
It wuz a hotel for Americans that
Martin had gone to, and it wuz jest like the best
of our American tarverns.</p>

<p>Josiah sez, when he see the bright lights in our
room, “Thank Heaven, I won’t have to use my
candles!”</p>

<p>He had hearn that folks had to furnish their
own lights in England, so he’d lugged round a
couple of taller candles, run in our own candle
moulds to home.</p>

<div class="figright illowp79" id="i_395" style="max-width: 10em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_395.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A hull soap-box full.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I told him not to, but he sed he wuzn’t goin’ to
pay no high price for lights when we had a hull
soap-box full under the suller stairs. So he had
took ’em at the resk of spilin’ his dressin’-gown, as
I told him.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t resk that,” sez he; “that is to the
top of the trunk. The candles are packed down
with my Sunday suit to the bottom of the trunk.”</p>

<p>I changed their position.</p>

<p>But his feelin’s for that dressin’-gown
are simply idolatrous, as I tell
him&mdash;specially the tossels.</p>

<p>And he said he “never thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>of makin’ idols of ’em&mdash;worshippin’ a tossel!”
sez he, scorfin’ly. But he duz think too much
on’t.</p>

<p>Wall, the next mornin’ the fog seemed to be
lowered a little. I could see the sun, or pretty
nigh see it, which I felt wuz indeed a blessin’; and
after a good breakfast we sot off on a excursion.</p>

<p>I had sed from the first minute London wuz
talked on, that Westminster Abbey wuz my first
gole, and the rest seemed to feel a good deal as
I did. Al Faizi and Alice wuz dretful anxious
to see it, and Martin sed&mdash;</p>

<p>He thought it wuz probble what would be expected
of him, and if he wuz summoned home
on account of his business, he said he <i>must</i> be
able to say that he had been to Westminster Abbey,
anyway.</p>

<p>So he engaged a big carriage, and we sot off,
Josiah kinder laggin’ back and actin’ onwillin’. He
had found a New York <i>World</i> in the readin’-room
for the first time sence he left home, and he sed
openly&mdash;</p>

<p>That he had ruther stay to home with his dressin’-gown
on and read that paper than to see any
Abbey that ever wuz born.</p>

<p>He thought it wuz some noted woman, and I
wuz deeply touched by his preference, and cast-iron
principle; but I explained, and would make
him go. So we sot off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span></p>

<p>Wall, the first view I got of that imposin’ edifice
looked jest as nateral as could be; for Thomas J.
has got a big photograph of it framed in his office,
with the two great, high towers, 225 feet high, and
the big Gothic winder between ’em, and the great
Gothic door below. The buildin’ is a immense
one; it is built in the form of a cross, and is more’n
five hundred feet long.</p>

<p>I can tell you, I had a sight&mdash;a sight of emotions,
and about as large sized ones as I ever had, as I
stood inside, under them lofty arches, full of the
mellow light of the stained-glass winders, and looked
off down, down that long colonnade of pillows, at
the end of which, fur off, is the chapel of Edward
the Confessor.</p>

<p>This chapel is full of the tombs of kings and
queens&mdash;Henry III., in brass, lyin’ on top of a huge
porphery tomb; Edward I. and his queen, Eleanor,
who sucked the poison from her husband’s wound
in Palestine; and Queen Philippi, who put down
a insurrection in Scotland, while her pardner, Edward
III., wuz away from home.</p>

<p>Noble creeters! I wuz proud on ’em as I thought
over their likely, riz-up deeds. I couldn’t have done
more for my Josiah, and I felt it as I looked on ’em.</p>

<p>Wall, I said that the very first place I wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
see wuz the place sacred to the Great Dead. So I
went off kinder by myself, as I spozed, led by a
guide, but the rest follered on after me.</p>

<p>Martin said that if a telegram should recall him
home sudden, he spozed it would be expected of
him, anyway, to say that he had stood by the monuments
to Shakespeare, Dickens, Thackeray, etc., in
Westminster Abbey. Sez he, “I have never read
the poems of the last two gentlemen, but I hear
that they are very creditable; so much so, that I
have heard their names mentioned often, and I
would like to say that I have stood by their remains.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’ to Martin, but the feelin’s as
I stood right by the side of that man made a deep
gulf that swep’ him fur off away from me, and swep’
me back into a life that seemed more real, almost,
than my own.</p>

<p>Little fingers plucked at my gown, as it were,
and, lookin’ down, I see the brave, patient face of
Little Nell, and Tiny Tim, and David Copperfield,
and the old-fashioned looks of little Paul Dombey,
and Little Rowdey, Becky Sharp’s neglected boy;
and little Clive Newcome’s sturdy figger wuz
pushed away anon by the tall, slender figger that
walked by his cousin Ethel Newcome’s side with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>a achin’ heart. I seemed to hear the Old Colonel
saying “adsum” to the Heavenly roll-call.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gummidge’s melancholy voice, recallin’ the
“old un’,” mingled with Peggotty’s comfortin’
talk and tender words to “Little Em’ly;” Mrs.
Micawber, bearin’ the twins, passed on before me;
Micawber, Dombey, Pecksniff, Little Dorrit’s
patient form, Bella Wilfer’s handsome, wilful face
went by me, a-lookin’ up, coquettish, but lovin’, into
the sad, reasonable eyes of “Our Mutual Friend.”</p>

<p class="h2sub">WESTMINSTER AND PARLIAMENT HOUSES.</p>

<p>I see Captain Cuttle and Bunsby fleein’ from
Mrs. McStinger, and Wall’r Boy and his uncle,
and Susan Nipper and Toots, and Mrs. Pipchin,
and sweet Florence a-walkin’ by the Little Brother
where the wild waves were talkin’ to him and the
silver sails a-beckonin’ him over into a fur country&mdash;David
Copperfield; Dora, the child wife; Agnes
Wickfield, with her finger on her lips, and a-pintin’
upwards; dear Aunt Betsy Trotwood, and Oliver
and Nicholas Nickleby; Mrs. Jellaby, with her
dress onhooked and droppin’ papers with absent
eyes, and Esther and Guardy, and Skimpole and
the little Pardiggles&mdash;</p>

<p>How the crowd swep’ by me! It wuz a sight.</p>

<p>Ophelia passed by with her apron full of flowers,
and she said to me, with a sad look out of her sweet
dark eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here is rosemary, I pray you, love, remember.”</p>

<p>Truly, I didn’t need her reminder&mdash;my soul wuz
all rousted up and a-rememberin’.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span></p>
<p>I remembered the young feller she kep’ company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
with&mdash;yes, indeed! Hamlet, “the expectancy and
rose of the fair state.” His shadder follered her
clost, and I almost said to him with Horatio, “Good-night,
sweet prince.”</p>

<p>But he looked kinder curous&mdash;he wuz a little off
and acted, and, poor creeter! so wuz she, too; I felt
to pity ’em both, and anon she seemed to be singin’
the song that Hamlet ust to sing to her when he
wuz a-waitin’ on her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Doubt that the stars are fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Doubt that the sun doth move;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Believe that truth is a liar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But never doubt that I love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She believed still in his constancy. She wuz a
good deal out of her head.</p>

<p>Then Rosalind and Queen Catharine’s stately
figger glided by; and eloquent Portia and Lady
Macbeth a-holdin’ up her lamp, a-lightin’ her on to
crime&mdash;the light a-shinin’ back into her dark, evil
face&mdash;</p>

<p>And old King Lear, with faithful Cordelia a-holdin’
his tremblin’ old arms, and a-helpin’ him along.</p>

<p>Then, feelin’ pensive&mdash;Il Penseroso, I seemed to
see John Milton’s blind eyes lookin’ into Paradise,
and the Fairy Queen seemed to look down on us
from the tablet of Spenser, and “Rare Ben Jonson,”
Chaucer, John Dryden, Thomas Gray&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span></p>

<p>I wuz a-walkin’ back with him in the old church-yard&mdash;“Where
the rude forefathers of the hamlet
sleep”&mdash;</p>

<p>When Martin interrupted me, and sez he&mdash;“Gray,
Thomas Gray, I suppose that is the father of Lady
Jane Gray.”</p>

<p>I didn’t dispute him, but as I looked at him
a-leanin’ back and a-feelin’ big, I allegored to
myself&mdash;</p>

<p>“We don’t need to remember Micawber or Dombey;
we’ve got a livin’ curosity with us.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi wuz deeply interested in the Poet’s Corner.
He stood long and silently by the graves of
the great dead, and his face wuz a deep mirror of
his thoughts.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_401" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_401.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>We stood long and silently by the graves of the great dead.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Alice wuz very much interested in ’em, too.</p>

<p>But as I stood by Goldsmith’s grave&mdash;a-seein’,
with my mind’s eye, Mrs. Primrose and Olivia and
the good Vicar a-moralizin’ at em&mdash;</p>

<p>I hearn Josiah say to Adrian&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oliver, goldsmith.” Sez he&mdash;“I spoze Mr.
Oliver wuz the best goldsmith in England, or he
wouldn’t be layin’ here. He probble made the
crowns and septers they all have to wear in these
monarkiel countries.”</p>

<p>I turned round, and sez<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span> I, “The metal that Goldsmith
used wuz purer gold than that&mdash;it wuz the
rare wealth of a faultless style.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” sez Josiah&mdash;“stylish jewelry,
and septers, and sech.”</p>

<p>But I explained it all out to Adrian, and kep’
him by me all I could.</p>

<p>Alice drawed my attention to the bust of Longfellow,
our own poet, and my emotions swep’ me
off quite a long ways, clear from this old Abbey
to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where descends from the Atlantic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gigantic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Storm winds of the equinox.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, he seemed to bear me clear to the musical
murmurs of Minnehaha, Laughing Water, and from
Acadia to Spain. I travelled fur and wide.</p>

<p>And then there wuz the tomb of Thomas
Campbell and Matthew Prior and James Watt and
Mrs. Siddons. Not all in one place are these tablets
and busts and monuments, but my mind seems
to kinder gather ’em in together as I look back.</p>

<p>The most elegant chapel in the Abbey is that of
Henry VII. Its noble arched ceilin’ is exquisitely
ornamented and carved&mdash;flowers, vines, armorial
designs, etc., etc., in almost bewilderin’ richness
and profusion. Henry and his wife Elizabeth the
last to rain of the House of York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span></p>

<p>In this chapel is also the tomb of poor Mary,
Queen of Scots, with her figger in alabaster on top
of it.</p>

<p>If it wuzn’t in alabaster&mdash;if she wuz alive, and if
the kings and queens wuz also alive and actin’&mdash;what
a time there would be in that old Abbey!</p>

<p>If that exquisite body had agin that rare gift of
magnetism&mdash;or, I d’no what it wuz, anyway, it
wuz sunthin’ that drawed men to her despite their
own will, and, it is needless to say, aginst their
pardners’ wishes&mdash;what a time, what a time there
would be!</p>

<p>How the emperors and kings and princes that
now stood so still and demute would gather round
her! How the wives would draw back and glare!
And mebby some on ’em, bein’ quick-tempered,
would throw their septers at her.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! mebby it’s jest as well that she is
made of alabaster; for not fur from her is the
tomb of Queen Elizabeth, a-layin’ down guarded by
four lions.</p>

<p>She’d a-needed ’em, Lib would, if she’d a-expected
to keep her lovers from a-follerin’ after
Mary. She wuz a jealous creeter, and vain, although
a middlin’ good calculator.</p>

<p>But Raleigh, and Leicester,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span> etc., etc.&mdash;lions
couldn’t a-kep’ ’em from the prettiest woman&mdash;no,
indeed!</p>

<p>In the same vault is Bloody Mary, who burnt up
about seventy folks a year durin’ her rain.</p>

<p>Al Faizi took out his little book with a cross
on’t, and wrote quite a lot here, and he also did before
Mary, Queen of Scots. I d’no, mebby he, too,
bein’ a man, felt some of the subtle charm that
surrounds her memory, even to-day, and keeps men
from ever doin’ plain jestice to her, and always will,
I spoze.</p>

<p>Not fur off is the restin’-place of the little
princes murdered in the Tower by Richard III.</p>

<p>Al Faizi writ sunthin’ here, too, in his book&mdash;quite
a lot.</p>

<p>There are nine chapels in the Abbey, each one
full of the tombs of ’em whom the world has
delighted to honor; and the guide told us that
many a king and prince lay here who had not any
memorial to mark his last sleep.</p>

<p>One of these wuz the “Merry Monarch,”
Charles II. Among the great crowd who surrounded
him, like a swarm of hungry insects, feedin’
upon him, and buzzin’ out their praise and
compliments and loyalty to him, and flatterin’ his
vices and weaknesses, not one of ’em thought
enough of him to rare up the least little mark to
his memory&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>A deep lesson of the worthlessness of worldly
praise or blame. A great contrast to this is the
monument to Charles and John Wesley. They
worked on all their lives, a-preachin’ and a-warnin’
aginst the vices of the great, as well as the humble,
and here they have their monument amongst the
royal dead.</p>

<p>Another thing that interested me in the Abbey
wuz the Coronation Chair, in which every sovereign
in England, from Edward the Confessor
down to Queen Victoria, has been crowned.</p>

<div class="figright illowp68" id="i_407" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_407.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>An immense chair, the four legs bein’
four animals.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a immense chair, the four legs bein’ four
animals&mdash;lions, I guess, though they looked kinder
queer. But mebby they wuz a-thinkin’ who and
what they wuz a-holdin’ up that made their hair
stan’ out so kinder queer, and their tails curl up
so.</p>

<p>Under the seat wuz a queer-lookin’
slab of stun, and they said it
wuz the very stun Jacob had his
head pillered on. It wuz carried
back and forth by his descendants,
and finally got to Ireland, where
it wuz used at the Coronation of
the Irish Kings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span></p>
<p>Some say that if the one who wuz a-bein’
crowned wuz unworthy royal honors, the stun
would groan, but kep’ still if it wuz the right one
in the right place.</p>

<p>I should have thought it would have done considerable
groanin’ in the centuries gone by&mdash;in the
case of Henry VIII., for instance, etc., etc.</p>

<p>I don’t believe it groaned the last time it wuz
used. No; as a female a-thinkin’ of a female, I wuz
proud to contemplate the fact that most probble it
never gin a single groan, or even a sithe, at that
time.</p>

<p>Some say that wimmen can’t rule good, but
hain’t Victoria rained well and rained long?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Wall, we lingered in this venerable and intensely
interestin’ place for a long time, and until the
gnawin’s of hunger woke in my pardner’s inside,
and he gin pitiful expressions of his inward oneasiness.</p>

<p>But Martin sed he must visit the Housen of
Parliament. He sed that it would certainly be
expected of him; so we went through Westminster
Hall to the new Palace of Westminster, as the
buildin’ is called.</p>

<p>The laws made here ort to be noble and big-sized,
indeed, to correspond with the place they are made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>in. It covers eight acres of ground, has eleven
hundred rooms, one hundred stairways, and eleven
courts. It cost over fifteen millions, so they say.</p>

<p>But I d’no, I didn’t feel ashamed of our own
Capitol at Washington when I see it. That is a
good sizable buildin’, and made on honor, good
enough and big enough to correspond with the laws
made in it.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Wall, Westminster Hall, that we went through
to go to the House of Parliament, wuz dretful interestin’.</p>

<p>The great Hall of William Rufus wuz built first
in 1097. Rufus wanted a great Hall, where he
could hold banquets, and not feel crowded, and feel
that he had air enough, and wuzn’t in any danger of
hittin’ his head on the ceilin’, so he built this Hall.</p>

<p>It wuz partly burnt up once, but it has been repaired,
so that it is a room now good enough for
anybody, and big enough so’s the World and his
wife and children could eat dinner here if they
wanted to, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>It is three hundred feet long, seventy feet wide,
and ninety feet high. The ruff overhead is carved
into many beautiful forms, and is one of the largest
in the world that has no columns or supports from
below.</p>

<p>Glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span> seens have been enacted in this Hall, as
well as dretful ones. After the Hall wuz built
over and beautified by Richard II., the very first
public meetin’ held in this Hall wuz to take away
his crown and septer and send him to prison.</p>

<p>Poor thing! after all he’d went through buildin’
it. I should thought them old timbers and jices
would have creaked and groaned to have seen it go
on.</p>

<p>I know well how I should have felt after we got
our house altered over, and I’d jest got the parlor
papered and carpeted and new curtains up, if I’d
had to be dragged off and shet up, and let Sister
Bobbett or Sister Henzy move in and take the
comfort of it.</p>

<p>And I spoze Richard had feelin’s as well as myself,
and the splendor of my parlor would mad me
all the more to leave it, even if it shed a glory over
the seen.</p>

<p>Charles I. wuz tried in Westminster Hall and
condemned to death, and a few years later Oliver
Cromwell was inaugerated in it Lord Protector of
England.</p>

<p>He sot in that Royal Chair, which wuz took out
of Westminster Abbey for the first and last time.
The chair never groaned or took on any as I’ve
ever hearn on, but I should have thought it would,
not for reproof, but for sorrer. For only five
years after that Cromwell died, and wuz buried in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
Westminster Abbey amongst its royal dead, and then
three years later his body wuz took up and hanged
on Tyburn by command of the king, and his head
wuz displayed on the pinnacles of Westminster
Hall with Bradshaw and Ireton.</p>

<p>Hangin’ a man who had been dead for three
years, and for doin’ what he thought wuz right!</p>

<p>Al Faizi wrote quite a lot in his book here. He
looked queer as he meditated on a civilized country
committin’ sech barbarities.</p>

<p>They laid out to have the skulls remain up there
on them pinnacles for thirty years, and some say
they did, and some say Cromwell’s blew down durin’
a hard storm, and some of his descendants have
got it to this day, and several of his skulls are in
other places, so we hearn.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! He seemed to have as many
heads as Columbus had faces. It beats all what
them poor old fourfathers went through.</p>

<p>In this Hall Charles I. wuz condemned to die,
and also Sir William Wallace, that Josiah and I felt
so well acquainted with, havin’ formed his acquaintance
and loved him through Thomas Jefferson and
“The Scottish Chiefs.”</p>

<p>And Sir Thomas More, that witty, smart
creeter&mdash;philosopher, statesman, and everything else&mdash;the
favorite of Henry VIII., and who succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
Cardinal Wolsey as Lord High Chancellor, but
who lost Henry’s favor in his life, by not approvin’
of Henry’s stiddy practice of marryin’ wimmen and
then cuttin’ their heads off, and marryin’ another
and another, and so on and so on. Here the poor
creeter had his trial.</p>

<p>Robert, Earl of Essex, wuz tried here and condemned;
and so wuz Guy Fawkes, and the Earl of
Stafford, and many, many, many others.</p>

<p>Wall, in the House of Parliament we see Parnell,
the great helper for Irish rights. And it did my
soul good to look on Joseph Arch, who wuz elected
to Parliament as a representative of agricultural
laborers.</p>

<p>He wuz a plough-boy, and his mother learnt him
to read and write. She wuz a earnest Christian.
Later he become a local preacher in the Methodist
Meetin’-House. Afterwards, meditatin’ on their
wrongs, he organized a union of agricultural laborers,
and finally wuz elected to Parliament. He
wuz sent from that deestrict where the Prince of
Wales lives. And you would have thought that
some richer and more aristocratic man would have
been chose to stand for that place, so nigh to the
British throne.</p>

<p>But no, a good <span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>man, a man of the people, wuz
chose. The Prince of Wales never done a thing to
break it up, so they say. He is quite a sensible,
good-hearted creeter, the Prince is. Though, like
the rest of the world, he has his failin’s.</p>

<p>Here we see Gladstone, that noble creeter. A
man that will be revered and beloved and held dear
to grateful hearts when lots of contemporary emperors
and kings are forgot.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!</p>

<p>The House of Lords is made up of lords temporal
and lords spiritual&mdash;twenty-six lords spiritual,
which are the Archbishops of Canterbury and
York, and twenty-four Bishops, Dukes, Earls,
Barons, etc., make up the lords temporal&mdash;they
come into their places by the right of their titles,
which fell onto ’em onbeknown to ’em. Here they
set makin’ laws with their hats on.</p>

<p>Josiah drawed my attention to it, and sez he,
“You’ve always tutored me so about takin’ off my
hat everywhere and in every season. I’ve had sun-strokes
and froze my scalp a number of times in
carryin’ out your orders; but,” sez he, “I’ve made
up my mind, Samantha, as to one thing, and you
can’t change me.”</p>

<p>I have a deadly fear of his plans, and can’t help
it&mdash;in fact, I have reason to, as dire experience has
often showed me the dretful results flowin’ from
’em anon or oftener; so I waited with breathless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
dread to hear him expound his plan.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I’m bound on it. When I’m elected to
Congress I’m goin’ to wear my hat the hull time I’m
there; I hain’t a-goin’ to take it off only to go to
bed; I calculate to have a good warm head the rest
of my life.” Sez he, “If it’s proper for ’em, in
their high station, it’s proper for me, when I git
there.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp55" id="i_415" style="max-width: 30em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">When I’m elected to Congress I’m goin’ to wear my hat the
hull time.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>I thought a minute, and then sez I, “Wall, I
guess I’m safe in not objectin’ to it.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “You mean by that, that I won’t git
there, but you’ll see, mom. The minute I git home
I’m a-goin’ to organize the farmers. I’ll organize
Ury the first one, and then I’ll organize old Gowdey.
Uncle Sime Bentley I can depend on.” Sez
he, “If Arch and Burt and Macdonald, all on
’em workin’ men, can git into Parliament, what
is to hender Josiah Allen from shinin’ in Congress?”</p>

<p>Sez I mildly, “Nater broke <i>that</i> up from the
start.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “Do you mean that I can’t git in?”</p>

<p>Sez I, still more tenderly, “I alluded to shinin’,
Josiah; but,” sez I soothin’ly, for I see that his liniment
begun to darken&mdash;sez I, “I won’t say a word
agin your wearin’ your hat under them circumstances.”
Sez I in affectionate axents, “Mebby I’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>been too harsh with you about takin’ it off in cold
weather; mebby I hain’t made allowance as I should
for the weakness of the place exposed; mebby
etiket has ruled me too clost.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “You and etiket has been almost the
death of me time and agin.”</p>

<p>One thing that is sure to strike the tourist and
beholder with wonder is the extreme smallness of
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>How five hundred and sixty folks could ever git
into that room is a wonder to me, and the guide
told us that there had been as many as that a-standin’
there time and agin&mdash;a-standin’, of course, for
there wuzn’t no room for ’em to set.</p>

<p>It struck Josiah, too, though, as usual, our meditations
wuz fur different.</p>

<p>I methought, “No wonder laws hain’t what they
ort to be, made in sech a tight place, by folks jest
crowded and squoze in together like sardeens in a
box.”</p>

<p>And Josiah methought out loud, “You thought,
Samantha, that I didn’t allow half room enough in
my new hen-house, and my brood of fowls have as
much agin room accordin’ as these law-makers
do.”</p>

<p>“Wall,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span> sez I, “there both on ’em kep’ in too clost
quarters to do well.”</p>

<p>But truly I couldn’t break it up, for time and
Martin didn’t give me no chance.</p>

<p class="h2sub">SAMANTHA SEES A DOCTOR.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been in London for more’n a short
time before I wuz attacked with a queer feelin’
and pain in my back. It seemed to be the worst
on my right shoulder blade. It wuz a pain and a
soreness all together, and the surface indications
pinted to more trouble if I didn’t tend to it.</p>

<p>Josiah rubbed it with assiduity and camphire, and
in hours of solitude bathed it in anarky.</p>

<p>But to no purpose&mdash;it grew worse and worse,
and I feared it wuz a bile, but didn’t know.</p>

<p>It kep’ me awake nights, and I spoze it made
me fraxious and restless, for Josiah urged me
warmly to have a young man, who wuz a doctor in
the hotel, look at my back and see what ailed it.</p>

<p>And I sez, “I hain’t a-goin’ to have that young
man foolin’ round my shoulder blades.” Sez I,
“It would make me feel queer as a dog to think
he wuz a-lookin’ at it through that eyeglass of
hisen.” Sez I, “Neuralgy hain’t to be fooled
with.”</p>

<p>“I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span> you said,” sez he, “it wuzn’t neuralgy;
you said it wuz sunthin’ mysteriouser.”</p>

<p>“Wall, so I do say,” sez I; “it is sunthin’ I
d’no anything about. It is sore as a bile,
and anarky don’t seem to relieve it a mite. If I
had some good lobely and catnip,” sez I, “I believe
I could make a poultice that would relieve
it; but where would I git lobely and catnip here?”
sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he&mdash;willin’ creeter always when I
am sick&mdash;“Martin and I had made a agreement
to ride to Hyde Park this mornin’, and I shouldn’t
wonder a mite if I could find some lobely and
catnip growin’ there idegenus. I will look for
some, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Catnip in Hyde Park!” sez I mournfully; “you
might as well look for a angel at a dog fight, or
a saloon in Paradise!”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “if I can’t find any myself,
I’ll ask the policeman if he knows of any little
corner or shady place where I’d be apt to find a few
sprigs for you.” Sez he, “I’d go to Windsor Park
for you in a minute if I thought I could git sunthin’
to relieve your pain&mdash;I’d go to Langly Marish.”
(Marish is marsh writ long.) Josiah thought that
he would spell his old marsh in the beaver medder
“marish,” for style&mdash;Jonesville Marish&mdash;but I told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>him that that wuzn’t goin’ to make him any nearer
the royal family, or make him act any more royal.
I guess I broke it up.</p>

<p>But to resoom&mdash;</p>

<p>Sez I, “It is good of you to think on’t, but I
wouldn’t want to tackle Victoria the first thing for
catnip. I d’no as she has put up any more herbs
than she wants to use herself&mdash;her family is big,
and she has frequent calls for catnip, anyway.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “I wuzn’t a-layin’ out to tackle Victoria
for it. I wuz a-goin’ to hunt round myself for it
in the park.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You’d only tire yourself out for nothin’;
you wouldn’t find a sprig. And if you found any,
I wouldn’t want you to pick it without Victoria’s
consent&mdash;it would like as not be some she had saved
for the children or grandchildren; no,” sez I, “I
will suffer and be calm,” and I sithed.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I’m goin’ to be minded in this
matter&mdash;I am goin’ to have you see a doctor, and
I hain’t a-goin’ to put it off another day. You
might put it off too long, and then what would the
world be to me? What would life be without
Samantha?”</p>

<p>His tender tones touched my heart considerable,
and I promised I would see a doctor that very day;
so he went away, quite contented, with Martin.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>That little dude doctor, with
his cane and his eyeglass.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, after he had went away, and I wuz left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
alone with my promise, I rumineated in deep
thought. And the more I thought on’t, the more
I hated to have that little dude doctor, with his
cane and his eyeglass, a-reconoiterin’
round my back and a-laughin’ at me,
for all I knew&mdash;for I felt instinctively
that he wuz one that would laugh
at a person’s back, and I felt that in
this case I should be the means of
lurin’ him into that wickedness and
deceit.</p>

<p>He looked conceited and disagreeable
in the extreme, anyway, and I
didn’t put any dependence at all on
his jedgment.</p>

<p>But then my promise confronted
me; what should I do? But as I
mused I happened to think&mdash;besides
this little dandy doctor, with his case
of medicine, a-goin’ to and fro, I had
noticed a tall, dignified, good-lookin’,
middle-aged man a-goin’ up and down the halls
with his case of medicine.</p>

<p>He usually went up the stairs as we wuz a-goin’
out&mdash;about 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;and, thinkses I, here is a chance
to keep my promise, and mebby git relief. For it
stood to reason that I had ruther display my right
shoulder blade to a middle-aged, sober man, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span> a
wife and children and grandchildren, and other
things to stiddy him down, than to a little snickerin’,
supercilious young chap, who hadn’t any wife, or children,
or any other trouble.</p>

<p>So I left my door on a jar, and waited for his
comin’. I got my dress waist so’s I could slip it
off in a minute, and throwed a breakfast shawl
gracefully round my figger, and waited calmly the
result.</p>

<p>Anon I heard a step approachin’, and I looked
out, and I see that it wuz the young doctor. He had
a posey in his buttonhole and he wuz a-hummin’ a
light tune and a-swingin’ his cane in his right hand,
and I felt more and more relieved to think it wuz
not my fate to tackle him.</p>

<p>Anon a hall-boy went by slowly, a-bearin’ a
pitcher of ice water; anon a chambermaid, and then
I recognized a messenger’s slow, haltin’ step.</p>

<p>And then I see the doctor’s benine face, framed
in gray hair and ornamented with whiskers of the
same color, approachin’.</p>

<p>I folded my breakfast shawl closter around my
form and advanced to the door, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Can I speak to you for a moment, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span> like to employ you for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, a-enterin’ the room willin’ly, as if
it wuz the way of his business, as doctors always
do.</p>

<p>He looked round the room enquirin’ly as he entered,
and as if mentally in search of sunthin’. And
I spozed mebby it wuz to see if he could see signs
of any other doctor’s medicine or sunthin’. And I
spoke up, and sez I:</p>

<p>“I have had some trouble with my back lately,
and I want you to look at it and see what is the
matter;” sez I, “I want to know whether it is
neuralgy or a bile.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp66" id="i_424" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_424.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">I have had some trouble with my back lately, and I want you
to look at it.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>He looked dretful surprised&mdash;I spozed he wuzn’t
ust to havin’ a complaint so queer and mysterious.</p>

<p>And I rapidly made my preperations, and presented
my left shoulder blade for his consideration.</p>

<p>And as I did so, I said anxiously&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is it a bile?”</p>

<p>I dreaded his answer. Neuralgy I felt I could
face, but a bile seemed dretful if met by me on
foreign shores, far from catnip and a quiet home.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I can’t tell what is the matter; if I were
in your place I would have a doctor.”</p>

<p>Mekanically, and like sheet lightnin’, I seized the
breakfast shawl and drawed its voluminous folds
about my figger and faced him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span></p>
<p>“Hain’t you a doctor?” sez I.</p>

<p>“No,” sez he; “I am a piano tuner. I thought
you wanted me to tune an instrument,” sez he.</p>

<p>I sunk into a chair and waved my hand towards
the door.</p>

<p>He bowed and vanished.</p>

<p>And I, a not knowin’ whether to laugh or to cry,
I did both at the same time. I felt meachin’, and
small, and provoked, and shamed, and tickled, and
mad, and everything.</p>

<p>But anon I thought I must not let this <i>contrarytemps</i>
(French) vanquish me. So I called on all
the common sense I had, and all the rectitude I had,
and I had a real lot of it when I got holt of all
of it.</p>

<p>For I realized that my motives wuz as pure as
rain water in a new cedar barrel, and so, bein’
dragged up to the tribunal of my own jedgment, I
could not find myself to blame; so I determined to
keep calm and not let the World or Josiah know
what I had been through.</p>

<p>For it wuz a hard blow onto both my jedgment
and pride, lookin’ on it with a nateral eye, and I felt
that Josiah and the World would be apt to look at
it through nateral eyes, and not through the rapt
vision of jestice that made me say and say calmly
that Josiah wuz the one to blame; for if he hadn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
extracted a promise from me, this <i>contrarytemps</i>
would not have occurred.</p>

<p>These large-sized emotions lifted me up quite a
good ways, and so I spoze it made the next notch
up come easier to me. For as I sot there I moralized&mdash;I
have been a-relyin’ on mortal ingregients to
help me and a-leanin’ on a pardner’s jedgment.</p>

<p>Ingregients have failed, pardner’s jedgment has
proved futile&mdash;futiler it did seem to me than anything
ever had before sence the world begun, as
futile as I have found ’em anon and oftener.</p>

<p>So sez I to myself, “What if I should branch
out and try the faith cure&mdash;turn aside from doctors
and pardners, reeds that have broke under my weak
grasp?”</p>

<p>I will! I will!</p>

<p>So I at once made my preperations for faith cure.
I het some Pond’s Extract in a little cup on the
gas&mdash;I had brung a little contrivance from home that
fitted the burner.</p>

<p>I het that extract as hot as I could bear it, and
bathed that shoulder blade in the soothin’ mixture;
I then wet a cloth in anarky, and rubbed it for a
quarter of a hour by the clock; I then put on a
strong poreus plaster I had by me, made from healin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>herbs; and then I het some more Pond’s Extract,
and put in some tincture of wormwood&mdash;I had a
little in a bottle&mdash;and I wet a woollen cloth in it
and laid it over the blade. I then filled my hot-water
bag with water and laid myself down on
the bed, with the warm, soothin’ rubber bag pressed
clost to the achin’ blade.</p>

<p>And then, havin’ completed these simple preleminaries,
I leaned on the Faith Cure&mdash;I leaned
heavy, and anon I felt that I had hit on the right
plan. The pain grew lighter and lighter, my thoughts
of the <i>contrarytemps</i> grew more peaceful and as if
I could bear it. I felt that I could forgive Josiah,
and then I knew nothin’ further for a long time.</p>

</div>

<p>Anon I seemed to be back in Jonesville; Philury
and I wuz down in our back paster a-pickin’
rossberrys. The sun shone down warm as I stooped
over the pink, laden boughs.</p>

<p>The crick under the hill tinkled melogiously&mdash;somebody
wuz tunin’ it, I
thought. It seemed to be playin’
melogious cords I had never
hearn before. A bird flew out
of the deep, green depths of
Balcom’s woods; it flew up in
front of me and lighted on
my forward, and said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span></p>
<p>“How do you feel, Samantha? Are you worse?”</p>

<p>I had layed there for five hours by the clock, and
it wuz my own pardner’s hand on my forward that
rousted me up.</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “Josiah; I am much better than I
wuz.”</p>

<p>“Did you git the doctor?” sez he.</p>

<p>That wuz a tender subject to me, but I wuz able
to meet it. I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“I thought I would try the Faith Cure, Josiah,
and,” sez I, “I truly feel like a new creeter&mdash;the
pain has almost all gone.” And it had, and from
that minute I gained on it fast.</p>

<p>At bedtime I tried the Faith Cure agin, after
goin’ through with the same simple preleminaries I
had went through, and the next mornin’ the cure
wuz almost complete, which made the trials that
begun as soon as I opened my eyes some easier to
bear.</p>

<p>I heard my pardner’s voice the first thing, out in
the hall, through the half open door. I hearn him
a-sayin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dum it all, don’t you never have day here? Is
it always night?”</p>

<p>“It is day now,” sez the voice of a agitated
chambermaid; “it is between 8 and 9 o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Pretty day!” sez Josiah. Sez he, “Look out
of the winder and see if you can see daylight; a
pretty day this is&mdash;dark as a stack of black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span> cats,
and darker, for you could see the cats if they
wuz a inch from your nose.” Sez he, “We have
been here three days, and I hain’t seen daylight
yet.”</p>

<p>He had a air of blamin’ the girl, and I interfered
and called him in; but the girl wuz waywised, and
she said, “It is very unusual weather, sir&mdash;very unusual.
We have never had such a fog before.”</p>

<p>They always say that, from Chicago and London
to Egypt&mdash;they “never had it before.”</p>

<p>It always happens dretful onfortunate jest whilst
you are there.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz jest preparin’ to blame the girl agin,
I dare presoom to say, when I hearn another voice
on the seen.</p>

<p>It wuz the voice of a Englishman that Josiah
had got some acquainted with, and who had disputed
warm with him about their two different countries,
each one on ’em a-praisin’ up his own native land
to the skies.</p>

<p>And Josiah made a derisive remark to him
right there in that untoward place about his “dum
climate.”</p>

<p>I wuz mortified, but couldn’t walk out and interfere,
not bein’ dressed.</p>

<p>After passin’ a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span> of sentences back and
forth, I hearn the Englishman say&mdash;</p>

<p>“This is a great country, sir&mdash;the sun never sets
on it.”</p>

<p>And Josiah sez in a real mean axent&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good reason for that! the sun never rises on’t&mdash;it
can’t go down where it hain’t riz! I hain’t
seen a ray of sunshine sence I come to England!”</p>

<p>Thinkses I, “Dressed or ondressed, I’ve got to
interfere,” and I hollered out agin, “Josiah&mdash;Josiah
Allen!” And he see in my axent a need of
haste.</p>

<p>And he come into the room, and I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t run down a man’s country on a empty
stumick, when it is as dark as pitch.”</p>

<p>And he sez, “Then I can’t run it at all.” His
axent wuz pitiful.</p>

<p>And it wuz indeed a fearful time.</p>

<p>The winder presented a black, murky appearance,
the gas wuz lit in the house and outside,
and away from the light the streets wuz as dark
as a black broadcloth pocket in a blind man’s over-coat.</p>

<p>We felt gloomy at the breakfast-table, but Martin
sed we must be gittin’ round some. So we
concluded to go to St. Paul’s Cathedral. So after
awhile we ventered to sally out. We wuz about
two hours a-goin’ a distance that ort to took us
about fifteen minutes&mdash;a-movin’ on through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
dense blackness, and not knowin’ what we wuz
a-comin’ up aginst, or who, or when, or what.</p>

<p>It wuz a fearful time, very.</p>

<p>We went in two handsomes (though their handsomeness
didn’t do us any good, for we couldn’t
see a speck on’t). Josiah and I and Al Faizi
went in one, and Martin and Alice and Adrian in
the other. A strange and mysterious journey as
I ever took, a-hearin’ anon or oftener a voice
up on top of our vehicle a-shoutin’ out replies to
the frenzied cries of cabmen on every side on him,
and a not knowin’ who or what we wuz a-goin’ to
run into, or be run in by. And the faint glow of
the street lights a-shinin’ through the black mists
like suns that wuz a-bein’ darkened, as the Skripters
tell on.</p>

<p>It wuz a fearful seen; my Josiah wuz well-nigh
prostrated by it, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“If I ever git where the sun shines in the daytime
agin, I’ll stay there.”</p>

<p>“So will I!” sez I, and I felt it, Heaven knows!
I wuz fearful agitated.</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, as a loud, skairful cry from the top
of our handsome wuz answered from others all
round us&mdash;</p>

<p>“Jest think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span> on’t, Samantha, how bright and
pleasant it is this minute in our back yard to Jonesville;
how plain you could see the side of the
barn; how the sun is a-shinin’ down on the smoke-house,
and hen-park, and leech barrel.</p>

<p>“Why did we ever leave them seens!” sez he.</p>

<p>“Why, indeed!” sez I.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Ury is mebby at this minute goin’ in to
the house, happy creeter!” Sez he, “A-walkin’
out a-seein’ every step he takes; and Philury
a-standin’ in the back door a-watchin’ him, and
a-lookin’ at the Loontown hills milds off, and the
Jonesville steeple.</p>

<p>“And we a-gropin’ along in perfect blackness
at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, and can’t see our noses. Why,” sez he
bitterly, “my nose is a perfect stranger to me; it
might be changed to a Roman or a Greecy one,
and I not know it.”</p>

<p>“You’d feel the change,” sez I.</p>

<p>“I d’no whether I would or not. I feel all lost
and by the side of myself,” sez he; “three more
days of these carryin’s on would make my brain
tottle.”</p>

<p>“Wall, it couldn’t tottle fur,” sez I. I said it
to comfort him, but it wuzn’t took so&mdash;no, fur
from it.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">ST. PAUL’S AND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</p>

<p>Wall, after a seen of almost inexpressible
wretchedness we reached St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p>Josiah a-gittin’ it into his head that it wuz fashionable
to read up about places of interest, had
flooded his brain almost beyend its strength to bear
about the Cathedral. And that information oozed
and drizzled out of the instersises of his brain all
the time we wuz there. As for me, when we entered
the great central western door I wuz almost
lost and by the side of myself as I ketched sight of
the vast interior.</p>

<p>As I looked down the immense, soft gray yeller
depths of distance, I felt almost as though I wuz
lookin’ down some of Nater’s isles, with shadders of
blue mist a-lurkin’ in the corners.</p>

<p>After my senses come back gradual I could pay
some attention to the rich, dark carvin’, the crimson
cushions, the big organ towerin’ up, etc., etc. I felt
lifted up considerable by the grandeur of the
spectacle.</p>

<p>But Josiah wanted to show off.</p>

<p>Sez he, a-wavin’ his hand down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span> the long aisle&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is the place for knaves! See, Samantha,
the beautiful arrangement&mdash;they’re set apart from
good folks. It sez the ‘knave runs down that way.’
He is made to run so’s to separate him still more
from Christians that go slow.”</p>

<p>“Where did you git that information, Josiah
Allen?” sez I.</p>

<p>“Right here,” sez he, and he took out his guide-book
and pinted to the words&mdash;</p>

<p>“The long nave runs down through the centre.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “How do you spell your vile person, Josiah?”</p>

<p>“N-a-v-e, nave,” sez he&mdash;“the easiest way.”</p>

<p>I groaned, and sez I, “I would shet up that book,
Josiah Allen, and go back to Webster’s old spellin’-book.”</p>

<p>He acted real pudgiky.</p>

<p>But Alice wanted to go into the North Chapel,
where the short service for business men wuz a-goin’
on, it bein’ almost noon when we got there. It wuz
a impressive sight to see these busy men takin’ a
breathin’ space from the hard labors of the day to
give thought to the Better Country and the best
way to git there.</p>

<p>A beautiful sculptured head of the Christ looked
down on these busy, careworn men, as if He wuz
sorry for ’em and wanted to give ’em a breath of
peace and love to go with ’em through the hot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
feverish toils of the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lookin’ up into the ineffible beauty and love
of that face, it didn’t seem as if those grocers could
put so much sand into their sugar and pepper, or the
merchants pay so little to the poor wimmen who
make the garments they sell.</p>

<p>But I d’no.</p>

<p>Wall, the chapel on the south side wuz meant to
be a place to administer jestice at different times,
affectin’ meetin’-housen and sech&mdash;what they call a
Consistery Court.</p>

<p>And here Josiah agin tried to explain things
to me.</p>

<p>Sez he, “This is called a Consistery Court&mdash;here
is where they try to be consistent when they attend
to affairs of the meetin’-house.”</p>

<p>And sez I in a dry axent, about as dry as a corn-cob,
sez I, “It’s a pity they don’t have sech a court
in American meetin’-housen.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “They’re needed there,” and my mind
roamed over the pressin’ need of consistency in sech
cases as Dr. Briggs, Parkhurst, Beecher, Heber
Newton, Felix Adler, Satolli, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>“And even in Jonesville,” I sez to myself, “is it
not possible to even now have one built in the precincts
of the Jonesville meetin’-house, where the
members could go in half a day or so a week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
and try to be consistent?”</p>

<p>Thinkses I, If they did honestly try to live up
to the buildin’ they wuz in, and be consistent,
there wouldn’t be so much light talk aginst religion
as there is now, and more young folks brung
into the church.</p>

<p>Howsumever, whether Josiah got it right or not,
one thing I do know, right in the midst of this
court is a elaborate monument to the Duke of
Wellington, that almost fills it up, so jestice is fairly
scrunched up and squoze for want of room.</p>

<p>That noble old Duke wouldn’t wanted it so. But
how little can we tell what people will do with
our memories when we have left ’em! But probble
most of us won’t have no sech immense memorial
riz up to us after we have passed away.</p>

<p>But my reflections wuz agin cut short, for Josiah
wanted to agin show off. Sez he, “The man that
that wuz riz up to wuz made of iron mostly&mdash;lost
his legs and arms, I spoze, and had iron ones made
to replace ’em.”</p>

<p>“Iron legs!” sez I; “how could he git round?”</p>

<p>“By main strength.” Sez he, “He wuz a powerful
man; he wuz called the ‘Iron Duke.’”</p>

<p>I gin him a pityin’ glance, but strangers wuz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>by, and I wouldn’t humiliate him by disputin’ him.
I merely sez, “If I wuz in your place I would
keep still for the rest of the day, Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>But Adrian, who took it all in good part, and
with immense interest, sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“How funny it must be to shake hands with
him, but how it would hurt to have him strike
you over the ear!”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Adrian, you keep with Alice and me.”
Sez I, “We’re a-goin’ to look at General Gordon’s
statute.”</p>

<p>This noble life and noble death are kep’ in
memory by a beautiful statute, recumbient and
a-layin’ down. The face, they say, is a good likeness.
And as I looked at it, the thought of that
noble and manly creeter almost brung tears to my
eyes.</p>

<p>Wall, we proceeded on eastward to the dome.
Here is the pulpit and the place where the bigger
part of the congregation sit.</p>

<p>Lookin’ up, we see glitterin’ spaces filled with
beautiful mosiacs, and up there are the benine
figgers of the Evangelists, and the four great
Prophets&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.</p>

<p>Agin that thought of what would be done with
our memories hanted me. They wandered about
in goats’ skins here&mdash;afflicted, persecuted; did they
think they would ever be throned in sech gorgeous
places? No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span></p>

<p>Above Daniel, Isaiah, etc., is the whisperin’ gallery,
where the lowest whisper, clost to the wall,
goes all round the entire distance&mdash;a sight, hain’t it?</p>

<p>And way up in the dome we see paintin’s of the
life of St. Paul and his deeds.</p>

<p>Wall, down on the floor to the south are immense
statutes to Lord Nelson and Cornwallis. Good
creeters, both on ’em, I believe, though mistook in
jedgment. And a great monument to Major-General
Dundas. There wuz lots of monuments to
other eminent men. Most of the statutes, as is
nateral, as is done in our own country, wuz mostly
riz up to men who had been famous for fightin’&mdash;them
who had been successful in killin’ off thousands
and thousands of men, leavin’ trails of agony and
blood behind ’em, clouds of black gloom, under
which widders and orphans groped, seekin’ for
bread, and fallin’ down hopeless in the quest.</p>

<p>Wall, it’s nateral; I couldn’t say a word&mdash;America
duz it.</p>

<p>I also see, as in America, the skurcity of female
statutes. We see the absolute dearth on ’em. Why,
if a inhabitant of Mars should light down there
some day and take a fancy to go through the
cathedral, he wouldn’t have a idee that there wuz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
ever sech a thing as a woman in the world. He
would go back to Jupiter and say: “One peculiarity
of the planet Earth wuz, there wuz no wimmen
there&mdash;only a race of men.”</p>

<p>And if they questioned him too clost how they
wuz born, he would say that most probble they
growed jest like trees.</p>

<p>And then the old Mars would gather round him
and congratulate themselves on bein’ on a planet
where equal jestice wuz awarded to men and wimmen
both, and where there wuz no more war.</p>

<p>The red lights on the planet don’t mean war, I
don’t believe; it means the rosy glow of the strange
foliage that the Mars gather for their children, and
the Pars, too, for all I know.</p>

<p>But I am indeed a-eppisodin’.</p>

<p>But a few centuries from now let that same
visitor come down and look into our great cathedrals,
on both sides of the Atlantic, and he will see
statutes to wimmen risin’ up jest the same as to
men. Under the benine faces of some on ’em he
will read&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is no more war, for the former things
have passed away.”</p>

<p>The former things wuz what made war&mdash;injestice,
intemperance, brutality, licenses for prostitution,
drunkenness, and infamy, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span></p>

<p>But I am a-eppisodin’ too fur, too fur.</p>

<p>The stained-glass winders we see on every side
wuz beautiful in the extreme. But if you’ll believe
it, this meetin’-house hain’t finished yet. Seein’
there has been a meetin’-house here for thirteen
hundred years or so, you’d a-thought they’d ort to
got it finished; but, then, they’ve been burnt out
several times.</p>

<p>I don’t want to brag over ’em, I didn’t feel like
it at the time, though I couldn’t help a-thinkin’
that we built the Jonesville meetin’-house in three
months. But, then, this one is bigger and has more
work on it.</p>

<p>Though the steeple on our meetin’-house is <i>very</i>
much admired.</p>

<p>Wall, we went down into the crypt. It is called
one of the finest in Europe. It is the same size as
the cathedral.</p>

<p>Here are some more warriors buried&mdash;Lord Nelson,
the Duke of Wellington, etc. But to give
credit to those who got up the buryin’-ground, there
are some ministers buried there&mdash;sech as Dr. Liddon,
Dean Milman, and eminent painters, sculpters, etc.</p>

<p>Here lies the great architect of the cathedral, Sir
Christopher Wren.</p>

<p>Josiah read the tablet on his grave, and then went
to explainin’ it to us.</p>

<p>Sez he, “It tells the date<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span> of his birth and his
death, and then it sez sunthin’ about spice&mdash;allspice,
I guess. Christopher wuz probble fond of it.”</p>

<p>Sez I, for I knowed the words by heart&mdash;</p>

<p>“Reader, if you ask where is his monument, look
about you.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “You’re wrong, Samantha. There’s
the word spice all writ out.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It’s a dead language, Josiah&mdash;I’ve translated
it. And,” sez I, “if you felt as I did a-lookin’
round on his matchless monument, sech as no man
ever had before, you wouldn’t talk about allspice.”</p>

<p>He acted real huffy, and moved on.</p>

<p>Here are many monuments to illustrious people
who are buried somewhere else.</p>

<p>Down here in the east end is a chapel where they
have early service every week day.</p>

<p>In the west end is kept the funeral car on which
the body of the Duke of Wellington wuz carried to
the grave&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the sound of the people’s lamentation.”</p>

<p>It is a handsome structer of gun metal. One
gun took at each of the Duke’s victories bein’
melted to make it. Twelve horses wuz needed to
draw this car&mdash;it broke through the pavement in
many places.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span></p>
<p>As I wuz a-explainin’ this to Alice, I hearn Josiah
say to Adrian:</p>

<p>“On account of his legs and arms bein’ so heavey,
I spoze, and his bein’ so great.”</p>

<p>And then I had to explain
to that child agin
that his greatness wuz
not his heft by the steelyards,
nor his bein’ called
iron wuzn’t because he
wuz made of cast iron.</p>

<p>I guess Adrian understood
it&mdash;I guess he did.
But Josiah Allen wuz a
drawback to correct information&mdash;indeed, he
wuz.</p>

<p>For as we wended on
I hearn him explain how
this cathedral wuz sot
on fire in 1590 by a
woman called Anne Domono.</p>

<p>Sez Adrian, “She was a bad woman, wasn’t she?”</p>

<div class="figleft illowp55" id="i_442" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_442.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“Yes,” sez Josiah, “old Domono probble had his
hands full with her.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” sez Josiah with a deep sithe, “old Domono
probble had his hands full with her&mdash;she wuz a
fiery creeter.”</p>

<p>But here I interfered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span> and explained it all out to
Adrian, much as I hated to go agin my pardner’s
words.</p>

<p>Strange doin’s has been done in this old meetin’-house
durin’ the long centuries that it has stood here.
It almost made my brain reel to think on ’em.</p>

<p>Councils of the church wuz held here, the Bishop
of Exeter sought refuge here from a mob&mdash;wuz proclaimed
a traitor and beheaded. Here Wyckliffe
wuz tried for his religious opinions. Here popes
sent out their legates. Here kings held their councils,
and here men and wimmen sold their goods.
And some with stuns and arrers killed the pigeons
who made their nests in the ornaments of the walls.
Here, too, they played ball and other games. Queer
doin’s for meetin’-housen, but it wuz true. But
what would the world say if my Josiah and Deacon
Bobbett should take to playin’ ball in the Jonesville
meetin’-house, or Sister Gowdy and I should play
tag round the pulpit? Why, how foreign nations
would be all rousted up and sneer at us!</p>

<p>Here the leaders in the War of the Roses acted
and carried on. Here Richard, Duke of York,
took a solemn oath to uphold Henry VI., and then
tried his best to shake him off the throne&mdash;lyin’ and
actin’ in a meetin’-house. Here the dead body of
Henry lay in state.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span></p>
<p>After the Reformation had begun it wuz desecrated
by the very meanest kind of doin’s. All
kinds of business wuz carried on, all kinds of amusements.
Busybodys and gossips made it their resort,
and the Holy Evelyn said&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was made a stable of horses and a den of
thieves.”</p>

<p>Then, if you’ll believe it, some of the reformers,
or them who called themselves sech (queer creeters,
I guess), stole the beautiful altar clothes, communion
plate, candleabra, etc.&mdash;jest carried ’em off under
the mantilly of religion they’d put on.</p>

<p>Curous! curous! but, then, that old mantilly
covers up lots of stolen things to-day, and meanness
of all sorts.</p>

<p>After this the grand old meetin’-house wuz completely
burnt down. I should thought it would
have expected lightnin’ to strike it, or sunthin’.
Anyway, it all burnt down to ashes. The present
buildin’ hain’t been misused in that way&mdash;the services
are carried on decently and in order.</p>

<p>Wall, we hung round there for more’n a half
day. Josiah had took the precaution to eat a hearty
lunch before we sot out, so he remained considerable
quiet till the nawin’s of hunger overtook him
agin. And we left at sunset.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">“THE WIDDER ALBERT.”</p>

<p>I’d told Martin when we’d first come to London
that I must see the Widder Albert whilst I wuz
there.</p>

<p>A few days had run by, and I sez to Martin&mdash;“Like
as not Victoria will be a-wonderin’ why I
hain’t been to her house.”</p>

<p>Of course when I first arrove I had sent her
word to once, and asked her in a friendly way to
come and see us jest as quick as she could, knowin’
that it wuz etiket for me to do so, and it wuz
nothin’ but manners for her to make the first
visit.</p>

<p>And a-takin’ it right to home, that if she had
come over to Jonesville, and wuz a-stoppin’ to the
tarvern there, it would be my place to make the
first call. I hain’t over-peticular in sech matters,
but still I set quite a store by etiket, after all, and
havin’ made the overtoor and sent the word that I
wuz here, I didn’t want to demean myself by actin’
too over-anxious to make her acquaintance, though
I did in my heart want to neighbor with her, thinkin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>quite a lot of her as a woman who had rained
long and rained well.</p>

<p>It wuz Martin that I sent the word by. He argued
quite a spell about the onproperness of my sendin’
sech word to a Queen. But I argued back so
fluent about the dissapintment it would be to her if
she didn’t know I wuz here, and my onwillin’ness
to hurt her feelin’s by my not makin’ myself known
to her, that I spoze he wuz convinced, for he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Leave it right in my hands; don’t say a word
to anybody else on the subject, and I will tend to
it in the right way.”</p>

<p>So I gin my promise, and as he hurried right
out of the room, I spoze he tended to it imegiately
and to once. And I sot in my room the rest of
that day in my best waist and my shiniest collar
and cuffs, expectin’ some that she would be to see
me before night.</p>

<p>And the next time I went out sight-seein’,
though I didn’t say a word about her, accordin’ to
my promise, yet I expected to go back and see the
benine face, mebby a-lookin’ over the bannisters
a-waitin’ for me.</p>

<p>I didn’t spoze she would have her crown on at
this time&mdash;no, I expected to see that good, likely
face surrounded by a widder’s bunnet, or mebby a
crape veil throwed on kinder careless like.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span></p>
<p>I knew we should be very congenial. We both
wished so well to our own sect&mdash;we wuz both so
attached to our pardners; and though hern had
passed on and mine wuz still with me, still I knew
we had so many affectin’ incidents of our early days
of our wedded love, before our perfectly adorin’
affection for Albert and Josiah wuz toned down by
time and walkin’ round in stockin’ feet, and
throwin’ crowns and bootjacks down in cross and
fraxious hours, when meals wuz delayed, or the
nations riz up and kicked, or the geese got into the
garden, or slackness about kindlin’ wood, or the
shortness of a septer, or etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Yes, I spozed we both had had our domestic
trials. I spozed that Albert had his ways jest as
Josiah has. Every pardner has ’em&mdash;they’re fraxious,
touchy at times, over-good at others, and have
mysterious ways. Men are dretful mysterious creeters
at times&mdash;dretful.</p>

<p>Yes, I felt that we could find perfect volumes
to talk over on this subject, for if ever there wuz
two wimmen devoted to their pardners with a devotion
pure and cast iron, them two wimmen wuz
Samantha and Victoria.</p>

<p>And then, too, we wuz both Mas. I spozed
she would tell me the good pints of Albert Edward,
and I laid out to tell her of the oncommon
smartness of Thomas Jefferson. And the more
she would enlarge on Bertie, the more I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
spread myself on Tommy.</p>

<p>And then the girls; how she would tell me about
Louise and Beatrice, and how I would tell her
about Tirzah Ann&mdash;how we’d praise ’em up and
compare notes about ’em.</p>

<p>I presoom her boys and girls didn’t always come
up to her idees of what girls and boys should do,
and should not do. And if she told me in confidence
anything of this sort, I wuz a-layin’ out to
confide in her about Tirzah Ann, and how her
efforts to be genteel wore on me, and how she
would love to flirt if it wuzn’t for religion and a lack
of material. And if she made any confidences to me
about Bertie&mdash;anything relatin’ to the fair sex, and
playin’ games, etc., I wuz a-goin’ to tell her, as
much as I love Thomas Jefferson, I thought he did
play checkers too much; and sence he wuz riz up
so as a lawyer, the wimmen jest made fools of
themselves and him, too, a-follerin’ him up and
a-makin’ of him; but, then, Maggie didn’t care a cent
about it, and that he wuz perfectly devoted to his
wife and children, jest as her boy wuz.</p>

<p>I wuz a-goin’ to say that I would never mention
these things to a single soul but her, anyway, but
I knew she would keep it, for she wuz jest like me&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
her boy didn’t please her, she went right to
him with it, and that ended it. She stood up for
him to his back, jest as I stood up for Thomas J.</p>

<p>Yes, I spozed we should take solid comfort a-confidin’
in each other, and mebby a-givin’ each other
hints that would be helpful in the futer.</p>

<p>And then we wuz both grandmas. How happy
we should be a-talkin’ over the oncommon excellencies
of our grandchildren!</p>

<p>For though we are both too sensible to act foolish
in sech matters and be partial, yet we both
knew there never wuz and probble never would be
sech grandchildren as ourn wuz.</p>

<p>And then I had some very valuable receipts I laid
out to gin her in cases of croup and colic, sech as
young people don’t pay much attention to, but
which I knew would jest suit her, and which might
come handy for her grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
I laid out to write ’em off for her. One
or two of ’em wuz in poetry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A handful of catnip steeped with care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a little lobelia throwed in there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mixed with some honey more or less,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will mitigate the croup’s distress.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some mustard seed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some onion raw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Applied to chests&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>I never saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A thing more strong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To draw, to draw.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The grammar wuzn’t quite what I would have liked
it to be in this last verse of poetry, but I made it in
a time of pain, and I knew that when croup and colic
wuz round, she nor I wuzn’t a-goin’ to stand on a
verb more or less.</p>

<p>And then I had another one:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some spignut roots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steeped on the fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is always good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my Josiah.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a little Balm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Gilead flowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is good to calm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In fraxious hours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I laid out to gin her all these receipts, and offer
to send her the ingregients for makin’ the mixtures.</p>

<p>Of course her pardner had passed away, but the
world is full of men and wimmen, and sickness and
fraxiousness are rampant, and good receipts like
these don’t grow on every gooseberry bush.</p>

<p>And then, I had a lot of other receipts I thought
she’d like. And I wuz a-goin’ to ask her for her
receipt for makin’ milk emptin’s bread; somehow,
mine had seemed to run out and not be so good as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>usual. And I had a receipt for corn bread that wuz
perfectly beautiful&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two measures of meal and one of flour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two of sweet milk and one of sour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a little soda and molasses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the literary treat of this poem, the excellence
of the bread wuz fenominal.</p>

<p>And then, how we both would love to talk about
the interests of the world at large! I wuz a-goin’ to
compliment her by sayin’ that though the sun never
set on her property, while it sot every day on ourn,
yet she couldn’t welcome the blazin’ sun of Righteousness
and Enlightenment any more gladly than
I did. And how first-rate I thought some of her
moves had been, and how highly glad and tickled
I’d been over ’em; and then I wuz layin’ out to draw
her attention to some tangles in the mane and tail
of the old Lion of England, a-tellin’ her at the
same time that I realized only too well the dirt and
onevenness in the feathers of our American Eagle.</p>

<p>I wuz a-goin’ to talk it over with her about the
opium trade, and the dretful intemperance and horrible
cuttin’s up and actin’s, and the dretful crimes
bein’ perpretated way out in Injy.</p>

<p>Dretful thing, indeed, takin’ a woman and ruinin’
her body and soul for time and eternity, and then
the goverment a-drawin’ money out of this eternal
shame and ruin. I spozed we should talk a sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
about that and draw lots of morals from it, too&mdash;draw
’em a good ways. And the horrible doin’s in
Armenia&mdash;I thought more’n as likely as not we
should both shed tears over it.</p>

<p>But, as I say, time had went on, and she hadn’t
come to see me yet. I asked Martin anxiously what
he spozed wuz the reason, and he gin me various
and conflictin’ answers.</p>

<p>Once he sed she wuz sick a-bed; and the next
hour, in answer to my anxious inquiry, he told me she
had gone on a visit to a fur country. And when I reminded
him of the descripency in his statements, he
come right out and sed she’d broke her legs&mdash;both
on ’em.</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “don’t make it public&mdash;it’s a State
secret.”</p>

<p>Wall, then I worried considerable about her, and
sed I ort to go and see her, and carry her some
Tincture of Wormwood.</p>

<p>And then Martin sed she wuz entirely well and
comfortable and happy, but couldn’t walk.</p>

<p>But I sez, “She might send me word.”</p>

<p>“She did,” sez he; “she tells you that the next
time you visit England she hopes to see you.”</p>

<p>“The next time!” sez I&mdash;“there won’t be no next
time. If I ever git acrost the ocean agin I shall stay
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” sez my Josiah; “if we ever see home agin
we shall probble never step our feet outside the
house agin, or the back door-yard.”</p>

<p>But I sez, “I shall probble walk round some in
the front yard, and mebby visit the children.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “Not for years, if ever.” Sez he, “I want
to set down on our back steps and set there for over
a year without gittin’ up.”</p>

<p>I felt that along in January he would be willin’
to move round a little and git into the house, but
that dear man can’t be megum.</p>

<p>Wall, with deep dissapintment I realized that the
Widder Albert and I wuzn’t a-goin’ to meet.
If she wuz in the state Martin said she wuz, of
course I knew she couldn’t take no comfort a-visitin’,
and I hain’t no hand to go and visit sick folks
if I can’t help ’em.</p>

<p>And I spoze, as Martin sed, that she had good
hired girls and everything done for her comfort.</p>

<p>But I worried about her quite a good deal.</p>

<p>But it wuz a comfort to me to think of what a
big house she had&mdash;it wuz big enough to hold plenty
of help, and it must have good air in it&mdash;yes, indeed!
The house itself is as big as from our house over to
Deacon Gowdey’s, and I d’no but bigger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span></p>
<p>Martin made a great pint on goin’ to see the
Bank of England. I believe he jest loves to walk
round the outside of buildin’s that has immense
wealth in ’em, if he don’t go inside. He and Josiah
went and wuz gone all the forenoon. I spozed it
would take a week to go through all the rooms.
Why, there is nine different door-yards right inside
the buildin’; they call ’em courts, and the rooms
open into ’em; so you can form a idee of how big
it is. But I didn’t seem to care so much about
goin’, so I stayed to home. I had quite a talk with
Al Faizi about it. He’d been a-huntin’ up facts
and idees, as his way is.</p>

<p>He didn’t condemn the ways of England at all&mdash;he
simply told the facts and left ’em, jest as the
’postles did. He sed he found that in the Bank of
England wuz the greatest wealth heaped up in the
smallest space that the world had ever known sence
the creation. And with the same air of simply
tellin’ a fact, and then leavin’ it, in the New Testament
way, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Almost in the shadow of this building, holding
the world’s wealth, I find the greatest want and
wretchedness and crime existing that I have ever
looked upon, and I believe the worst the world has
ever seen.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">Almost in the shadow of the Bank of England, I found the
greatest want and wretchedness.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>He didn’t say that there must be a screw loose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>somewhere in the great revolvin’ wheel of Humanity
to make sech a state of things possible. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>jest writ down sunthin’ in that book of hisen&mdash;mebby
it wuz expressions of wonder about our boasted
civilization havin’ accomplished so little in eighteen
hundred years, when the richest place on earth
should have its dark shadder of the greatest want
and crime clost to its side. No; he jest stated the
facts and let us draw our own morals, and as fur as
we wanted to. Martin didn’t notice his remarks,
nor see Al Faizi at all, so fur as I could observe.
He went on a-talkin’ with Josiah about the bank,
and about Rotten Row; he sed he wanted us to
see that, and wanted us to set off to once.</p>

<p>And I told Alice out to one side, when we wuz
gittin’ ready, that I didn’t know as I wanted her to
go into any sech a nasty place, or Adrian either. I
take good care of the children&mdash;yes, indeed I do!</p>

<p>But we found out when we got there that Rotten
Row wuz a elegant place, fixed off for ridin’ and
drivin’. Beautiful ladies and grand-lookin’ gentlemen,
and if there wuz anything Rotten about ’em,
it wuz on the inside of their phylackricies; the outside
of ’em wuz clean and brilliant.</p>

<p>Some say that the place where these great folks
congregate is well named, but I don’t believe everything
that I hear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span></p>
<p>Martin enjoyed the seen dretfully, though he sed,
on commentin’ on the ladies ridin’, that none on
’em could come up to an American woman in
grace, and he sed that the best ridin’ that he ever
see wuz by cow-boys on a Dakota ranch.</p>

<p>Wall, I couldn’t dispute him, never havin’ neighbored
with cow-boys. But let Martin alone for
findin’ out all the attractions of U. S. A. No;
U. S. A. won’t suffer in Martin’s hands, not at all.</p>

<p>As I sed, Martin and Alice went round quite a
good deal to see her friends&mdash;Lords and Ladies
some on ’em; she got acquainted with ’em to school,
when she wuz a-boardin’ with that Miss Ponsions, a
good likely school-teacher she wuz, so fur as I
could make out.</p>

<p>But owin’ to the Widder Albert enjoyin’ sech
poor health, and not bein’ able to git to see me, I
didn’t seem to want to go round so much. I didn’t
want to go to parties&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>Alice come home from one gin by Lady L&mdash;&mdash;,
and, if you’ll believe it, her pretty dress wuz all
crushed and torn, fairly spilte. Alice sed there
wuz sech a jam she couldn’t breathe hardly.</p>

<p>And I sez, “Sech doin’s don’t speak well for the
woman of the house&mdash;lady or no lady; and,” sez I,
“I’d love to advise her; I’d tell her that when I
give a quiltin’ or a parin’-bee I never invite more’n
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>can git round the quilt and the parin’ machines
handy and without crowdin’.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I could probble put idees into Lady
L&mdash;&mdash;’s head that would help her all her life in
futer parties.” But I didn’t happen to see her,
poor thing! and so I spoze she’ll keep on in the
old way.</p>

<p>I have known ’em who lived in the country, fur
back from the delights and advantages of Jonesville&mdash;I
have known them creeters, when they come
in on a saw log or on a load of calves to ship, I have
seen ’em look with perfect or at the commotion
and life in the Jonesville street, where, right in front
of the tarvern, I have seen with my own eyes as
many as five teams and two open buggies, besides
walkers on the sidewalk. This sight to ’em, fresh
from country wilds, where one wagon along the
road a day wuz a fair average, wuz as good as a circus
to ’em.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_459" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_459.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Right in front of the tarvern, I have seen with my own eyes as
many as five teams and two open buggies.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the Jonesvillians wuz ust to the rush and
bustle of them seven teams, and acted calm and
self-possessed and hauty through it all.</p>

<p>But I have seen the pride of them very Jonesvillians
took down when they visited New York.
There I have seen ’em stand with or on lower
Broadway, when they see the rush, and jam, and push,
and pull, and I’ve hearn their remarks, full as wonderin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>and as agitated as the backwooders from way
behind Jonesville.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span></p>
<p>That makes two ors, as I figger on’t.</p>

<p>Wall, here is another one jest as big or bigger;
set them New Yorkers, them very Broadwayers,
down in a London street, and you’ll have another
or jest as big to add as the two foregoin’ ones.</p>

<p>The crowd is jest as much immenser, the roar
jest as much louder, the jam, and push, and pull, and
drive, and yell, and crash, and scramble, and roar,
and rattle jest as much more enormouser.</p>

<p>Why, imagine the slate stuns down to the Jonesville
creek all springin’ up into men and wimmen, and
horses and wagons, and carriages and drays, etc., etc.,
etc., and you may have a faint idee of the countless
number on ’em; and then imagine over all that
seen a deep, black curtain of fog descended down
sudden, and out of that roar the crowds of vehicles
of all kinds, the yells of drivers, and most probble
the yells of skairt-out females a-blendin’ in it&mdash;imagine
it if you can; wall, that is a London
street.</p>

<p>I wuz considerable interested in the bridges of
London that crossed the Thames, and I meditated
every time I crossed one on ’em on Old London
Bridge, and what a seen, what a seen that wuz for
centuries; with houses built on each side on’t, merchants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>and dealers in everything, and artists and
preachers, for all I know. I know, anyway, one on
’em wuz a good preacher&mdash;the immortal Bunyan.
How he must have meditated as he see the throng
surge past him&mdash;old and young, beggars and princes,
velvet and rags!</p>

<p>How he must have thought of the hard journey
to the Celestial City, and what a hard tussle it wuz
to git there!</p>

<p>Hogarth lived here at one time, and mebby got
the idee of his “Rake’s Progress” from some of the
endless crowd he see go past. Anyway, he probble
see rakes enough, if that wuz all, for they have permeated
every field of life, a-rakin’ up all that is vile,
and leavin’ the flowers and sweet blades of grass as
they raked on.</p>

<p>Holbein lived here.</p>

<p>Life on that old bridge must have been a sight to
contemplate, havin’ a good time on it some of
the time, most probble, jest as we do in America
and Jonesville. But in times of highest prosperity
a-knowin’ that under ’em wuz a deep, black current
a-flowin’, jest as we know it in Jonesville, only
the current of Human Life is more mysteriouser
and vague.</p>

<p>Poor William Wallace had his head stuck up
here&mdash;good creeter, it wuz a shame after all he went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>through: a-losin’ his first wife and a-fightin’ so for
freedom. And Thomas More, and Bolingbroke,
and lots of others&mdash;middlin’ good creeters, all on
’em. And then there wuz traitors, Jack Cade, etc.,
etc., etc. I d’no but their heads did less trouble
here than when they wuz on their bodies, so fur as
the world wuz concerned, but I spoze it come tough
on ’em, a-seein’ these heads wuz the only one
they had.</p>

<p>And Martin took us to parks so beautiful and
grand that they took down Martin’s pride considerable,
and us Jonesvillians, whose grassy acre in
front of the meetin’-house had looked spacious to
us, laid out as it wuz with young maples and slippery
ellums&mdash;</p>

<p>But where wuz our pride, and where wuz Martin’s?
Think of four hundred acres all full of
beauty: that is Hyde Park. And Windsor Park,
Queen Victoria’s door-yard, as you may say, has
five hundred acres in it. Jest think on’t.</p>

<p>And there we’ve called our door-yard big, specially
sence we moved the fence and took in the
old gooseberry patch. I had boasted to neighborin’
wimmen that it must be nigh upon a quarter
of a acre&mdash;but five hundred, the idee!</p>

<p>Wall, I’m glad I hain’t got to tend to it, and
weed the poseys, and see that the grass is cut.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>But, then, she’s forehanded; she can afford to
hire.</p>

<p>But, amongst all the parks we went to, Josiah and
I seemed to like the Kew Gardens about as well as
any.</p>

<p>I had deep emotions, for wuz it not there that
Clive Newcome walked with Ethel? Her sweet
form clost to him, but the dreary sea of Hopeless
Despair a-surgin’ through his heart, a-seemin’ to
wash her milds away from him, and she also, visey
versey.</p>

<p>Poor young creeters! poor young hearts!</p>

<p>I seemed to see ’em a-walkin’ before me, with
downcast heads and sad eyes, all up and down
them lovely walks, jest as in Windsor Park I seemed
to see the Merry Wives of Windsor, and poor
old Falstaff a-settin’ out to meet ’em.</p>

<p>I seemed to look out with my mind’s eye for that
poor, foolish, vain old creeter more’n I did for
Victoria’s clothes, which I might have expected
would be hung out to dry that day&mdash;it bein’ a Monday,
and she sech a splendid housekeeper.</p>

<p>I have said what emotions rousted up in me as I
went through Kew Gardens; as for Josiah, he liked
’em because he could git provisions here of all kinds&mdash;good
ones, too, and cheap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">A VISIT TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>Wall, we went to the British Museum.</p>

<p>To give any idee of what we see in that museum
would take more time, and foolscap paper, and eyesight,
or wind and ears than I spoze I will ever be
able to command.</p>

<p>It is seven acres of land full of everything rich
and rare and beautiful from our time back to the
year one, and further, for all I know. The marbles,
engravin’s, picters, coins, manuscripts, curosities&mdash;if
I had the wealth of ’em in money&mdash;if I could
have the worth of jest one article out of the innumerable
multitude of ’em, I could jest buy out the
hull town of Lyme, and live on the interest of my
money.</p>

<p>The museum holds everything and more too.
And the library, why, it is most too much to believe
what we see there. Now, I’ve always had a Bible
and a New Testament, and have never gin much
thought whether there wuz any other different ones;
but I see with my own eyes seventeen hundred different
kinds of Bibles.</p>

<p>And good land! everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span> else accordin’&mdash;everything
else a-swingin’ out jest as regardless of cost
and space. The Egyptian Gallery wuz a sight to
see, and statutes and slabs older than the hills. Who
writ them words on ’em? Did the heads ache, and
hearts, jest as they do now? I spoze so.</p>

<p>Roman, Grecian, Assyrian galleries, galleries of
all sorts, birds and beasts and fishes enough to stock
the world, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>But most of all the relicks; some on ’em filled
my tired-out brain with or and wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>Milton’s contract with his publishers for “Paradise
Lost” (he got five pounds down, and wuz goin’ to
git five dollars more when the first edition wuz sold,
and so on).</p>

<p>They took the advantage on him; you know he
wuz blind, and couldn’t skirmish round and look
into things; so Paradise or not, they got the better
of him.</p>

<p>And then his widder; why didn’t they try to do as
they ort to by Miss Milton? She sold out root and
branch for eight dollars&mdash;the idee! Why, how many
copies have been sold of that book? Enough to
build up a mountain as high as the Catskills.</p>

<p>8 pounds for ’em&mdash;what a shame!</p>

<p>The publishers are dead, I spoze; yes, I spoze
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>Samuel Symon passed away years ago, but he left
quite a big family, and they all seem to foller the
old gentleman’s plans, and are doin’ first-rate and
layin’ up money real fast.</p>

<p>And I see Hogarth’s receipts for some of his picters.
And there wuz the very prayer-book used by
Lady Jane Grey on the scaffold.</p>

<p>“Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place for all
generations,” and “though I walk through the valley
and the shadow of death” I will be with thee.
I wonder if she heard the words when the shadders
lay so dark on her pretty head?</p>

<p>Then there wuz letters writ in their own hands
from Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell, Mary
Queen of Scots, Queen Elizabeth, Peter the Great,
Dudley, Leicester, Francis Bacon. And there
wuzn’t a word in Francises letter, so fur as I see, as
to whether he wuz Shakespeare or not, or whether
Shakespeare wuz him.</p>

<p>I wish I knew how it wuz!</p>

<p>And there wuz papers and letters from all the
kings and emperors, and George Washington right
amongst ’em&mdash;it kinder tickled my pride to see
George there, but he deserved it.</p>

<p>Then there wuz the old bull that gin Henry the
VIII. the name of Defender of the Faith. What
kind of faith did he act out&mdash;the faith that he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>marry more wimmen and chop their heads off than
any other old creeter this side of Blue Beard.</p>

<p>I should have been ashamed if I wuz him. If he
had been a woman a-marryin’ and a-killin’ and
a-marryin’, and etc., etc., etc., they wouldn’t have
stood it half so long&mdash;they would have broke it up;
it wouldn’t have been any worse in a female for
anything I know.</p>

<p>And then there wuz the message from Julius
Cæsar a-sayin’ that he had “Veni, vidi, vici.”</p>

<p>I spoze Thomas Jefferson would know jest what
that meant. Josiah thought it wuz sunthin’
about some wimmen&mdash;Nancy somebody, but I
d’no&mdash;I wouldn’t ask.</p>

<p>And then there wuz letters from good riz up
creeters, sech as John Knox, Sir Isaac Newton,
Cardinal Wolsey, Cranmer, Erasmus, etc., etc., etc.,
etc., etc., etc., and so forth.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz perfectly beat out when we got home
that night, and so wuz I.</p>

<p>But we found letters from home, and they
seemed to refresh us and take our minds offen
our four legs and our two dizzy and tired-out
heads.</p>

<p>Babe, sweet little creeter, she writ that she prayed
for me every night, and for her grandpapa, too. I
wonder if that is one reason why our legs didn’t give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>out completely that day, as they threatened to time
and agin?</p>

<p>Thomas J. and Tirzah Ann writ affectionate letters&mdash;Thomas
J. a-tellin’ us to be careful and not
overdo, and Tirzah Ann sent a
heart full of love, and a request
to git a yard and a half of lace
with deep pints on’t to trim a
summer waist.</p>

<p>Ury and Philury wanted to
know when we wuz a-comin’
home, and whether, with deep
respects, they should take up
the parlor carpet, that seemed
threatened with carpet bugs, and
whether it wuz best to break up
the 8-acre lot.</p>

<p>Oh, sweet and tender missives,
how near they seemed to bring
the old home to us&mdash;drag it
right along over the glassy
bridge of the Atlantic and land
it at our feet!</p>

<p>Wall, Martin sed he wouldn’t fail to see Madame
Tussaud’s wax figgers. He sed undoubtedly he
would be asked if he’d seen ’em. And Adrian wuz
anxious to go, thinkin’ it wuz sunthin’ like a circus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span></p>
<p>But we found it wuz a sight, a sight to see how
nateral they wuz. Why, some of the figgers almost
breathed, and you can see ’em&mdash;some machinery
rigged up inside, I spoze. And then we see kings,
and queens, and princes, and warriors, and everybody
else&mdash;we got fairly light-headed a-seein’ ’em
all, and I spoze Josiah got kinder excited and
wrought up, or he wouldn’t have done as he
did.</p>

<p>There wuz a old man a-holdin’ a programme in
his hand, and every little while he would lift up his
head and look round. He favored Deacon Henzy
quite a good deal, and Josiah sez to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“I believe that is Deacon Henzy’s cousin; you
know he sed he had one here in London. Don’t
you see he has got the real Henzy nose? I believe
I’ll be neighborly and scrape acquaintance with
him.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “he duz favor the Henzys, but,”
sez I, “don’t be too forred; the Henzys are big
feelin’.”</p>

<p>“Big feelin’!” sez Josiah; “don’t you spoze he
will be glad to see a neighbor of his own blood
relation?” Sez he, “He will be glad to neighbor
with me.”</p>

<p>I felt dubersome, but he advanced onwards, and
sez he in his most polite axents&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span></p>
<p>“Be you any kin of Bildad Henzy, of Jonesville?”</p>

<div class="figleft illowp50" id="i_468" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_468.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">Be you any kin of Bildad Henzy, of
 Jonesville?</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>The old man never moved, but read away, and
occasionally lifted his head and looked round, and
Josiah spoke agin a little louder&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be you any relative of Bildad Henzy?”</p>

<p>He never noticed my pardner any more’n as
if he wuz dirt under his feet, and my pardner got
his dander up, and he fairly yelled in the old man’s
ears&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be you a Henzy?” And bein’ mad, he added,
“Dum you! I believe you can hear if you want to.”
And he put his hand on the old man’s shoulder to
draw his attention to him. And for all the world!
if that man wuzn’t wax! Josiah looked meachin’
for as much as four minutes, and I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“I told you to look ahead.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t, nuther,” he snapped out.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “it wuz words to that effect, and
I wouldn’t try to be neighborly agin to-day.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “If I see a man afire I wouldn’t tell him
on’t.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “he would probble find it out himself;
but now,” sez I, “you’d better keep right by
me.”</p>

<p>Wall, as I said, we see every noted woman from
Queen Victoria back to Eve, I guess; and from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>Prince of Wales and his wife and children back to
little Cain and Abel&mdash;or I presoom Adam’s little
boys wuz there, though I don’t remember of seein’
’em. But there wuz Knights, Barons, Crusaders,
Kings, and Emperors, all dressed up in royal robes;
the Black Prince, as good a lookin’ young man as I
want to see, and Kings Edward and Richard and
Henry, and Queens Mary and Elizabeth, and Mary,
Queen of Scots, all ready to have her head cut off;
and her rosary, on which she had told her prayers
those dretful days, slipped through her fingers as
much as to say, I am goin’ into a country where I
sha’n’t want you any more. And there wuz Marie
Antonette&mdash;poor creeter! and Anne Boleyn, poor
thing! she’d better not married a widdower. And
Joan of Arc, noble creeter! I felt real riz up a-lookin’
at her&mdash;I always liked her.</p>

<p>And I wuz dretful interested in the Napoleon
rooms, full of the relicks of the great kingmaker.</p>

<p>There he lay, jest as nateral as life, on a bed, with
his cloak wropped round him&mdash;the very cloak he
wore at the battle of Marengo, and which he
wropped round his body some like a pall when that
heart had stopped its ambitious throbbin’s; and the
world breathed freer.</p>

<p>Then there wuz his coronation robe&mdash;and if you’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>believe it, the coronation robe of poor Empress
Josephine right by.</p>

<p>I’d a-gin ten cents cheerfully if I could have
got a little piece of both on ’em for my crazy
quilt. But I didn’t spoze they’d be willin’ to
have me cut ’em off, so I didn’t tackle the guide
about it.</p>

<p>And mebby it wuz jest as well, I d’no as I could
have slept much under them two robes and meditated
on what they had covered up. Love, triumph,
doubt, jealousy, heartaches, despair would permeate
the Josephine crazy block, and wild passions, and
burnin’ ambition, and cold, remorseless neglect, and
desertion would most likely surround the Napoleon
crazed block.</p>

<p>I d’no but I should have the nightmair every
time I tried to sleep under it.</p>

<p>Then there wuz his watch, stopped the minute he
died, his ring, camp knife and fork, coffee-pot, snuff-box&mdash;if
I hadn’t seen it, I wouldn’t believed he used
snuff, the idee is somehow so incongrous of the hero
of the Nile, the conqueror of Europe a-takin’ snuff.
Why, all Jonesville kinder looks down on old Miss
Moody because she takes snuff&mdash;black snuff, too,
scented high with bergamot.</p>

<p>Wall, one of the most life-like
relicks wuz one of his teeth; that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>wuz a part of the great emperor, or wuz once, before
it wuz pulled out.</p>

<p>I spoze it ached jest like anybody’s tooth, and I

way to jedge men.</p>

<p>Yes, I spoze you ketch any one man and study
him clost, and you have a good idee of the hull male
race.</p>

<p>And then there wuz a lock of hair, took right
from his scalp, so I spoze. Oh, what burnin’
thoughts and plans and ambitions once permeated
the spot on which that grew!</p>

<p>My emotions wuz a perfect sight as I looked at it.</p>

<p>And we see clothes and relicks of every other great
man, it seems to me, that ever lived&mdash;Lord Nelson,
Henry of Navarre, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>And we see figgers&mdash;lookin’ jest as nateral as if
they could walk up and shake hands with you, if
they wuz a-mind to&mdash;of Shakespeare and Macaulay
and Scott and Byron, Calvin and Knox and Luther,
Lincoln’s homely, good face, and Grant, Henry
Ward Beecher, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span></p>
<p>I wouldn’t give a cent to see all the figgers of
criminals and murderers, but Martin thought it advisable
to walk through it, so he could say he’d been
there, I spoze.</p>

<p>And there wuz one thing among everything else
that gin me more than seventy emotions, and that
wuz the very axe, the very old guillotine that cut
off the heads of twenty-two thousand folks durin’
the Rain of Terror in Paris.</p>

<p>I looked at the piece of iron with feelin’s, as I say,
beyend description.</p>

<p>And I wondered out loud if the iron wuz now dug
out of the sile that would make jest sech a horrible
instrument for America.</p>

<p>I groaned deep as I wondered it.</p>

<p>And Josiah sez, “You talk like a fool, Samantha!”</p>

<p>And I sez, “I hope I do, Josiah&mdash;I hope so!</p>

<p>“But what hammered this piece of iron out to its
terrible use wuz the fiery hammers of jealousy, and
fury, and hunger, and want, and the gay multitude
went on in its gayety and extravagancies, and didn’t
heed the sullen hammerin’s onto that iron, and
laughed at ’em that called attention to it&mdash;jest as
you are a-doin’ now, Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “You can talk about my extravagancies
if you want to, Samantha Allen, but I hain’t half the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>clothes you have, and they hain’t trimmed off anywhere
nigh as high as yourn are.”</p>

<p>But I went on, not heedin’ his triflin’ words.</p>

<p>Sez I, “The same furies are loose in the streets
of our American cities to-day&mdash;foolish suspicion
driv by mistaken zeal, jealousy, heartburnin’, honest
want, and need on one side; injestice, wrong, oppressions,
extravagance, indifference, anger, contempt,
etc., etc., etc., on the other side, all a-flamin’
up and a-holdin’ up a light for jest sech a axe to be
ground out. How long will I hear the sullen thunderin’
of the silent hammerin’s on the forge of ignorant
malice and hatred and jest anger&mdash;how long?”
And I sithed deep and heavey.</p>

<p>And Josiah sez, “What you hear is the thud of
folks a-walkin’ through the Chamber of Horrows.”</p>

<p>And sez he agin, “You talk like a fool! America
is good to the poor. Look at So-and-so, and So-and-so,
and So-and-so,” sez he, a-bringin’ my attention
to some of the most shinin’ lights in the field of
philanthropy and jestice.</p>

<p>Sez I, a-drawin’ his attention to the good philanthropic
works in France&mdash;sez I, “Paris had also her
So-and-so, and So-and-so, and So-and-so before the
Rain of Terror.”</p>

<p>And agin I gin several sithes and a few groans.</p>

<p>But my pardner looked cross as a bear, and dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
tired.</p>

<p>So, as allegorin’ and eppisodin’ must yield to the
powers of affection, I mekanically follered him in
silence through the halls, Martin and the children
bein’ in another part of the buildin’ and Al
Faizi somewhere a-lookin’ or a-takin’ notes in a
noble way&mdash;I hain’t a doubt of it.</p>

<p>But we all rejoined each other, and sot off home
to dinner amid Josiah’s great rejoicin’.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin took us to the Zoological Garden,
where we see all the dumb creeters that ever wuz
made, it seemed to me; and all used so first-rate
that it wuz a comfort to me to see ’em. Great
big cages, where they could roam round some and
enjoy themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i_477" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_477.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Josiah at the London “Zoo.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>And wuzn’t it a pleasure to see all the beautiful
birds, of every color and plume, from every
country from Eden down, a-playin round in the
trees and in the ambient air? The cages as big
as a door-yard, with trees in ’em, where they can
fly round in the branches. And water birds with
their own ponds to float in; and sea birds with
real sea-shores fixed up for ’em.</p>

<p>And so it wuz with every animal from a elephant
down, wild or tame. And I should have took a
sight of comfort here if I had had a pair of iron ear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>pans, or even gutty-perchy. But bein’ but flesh
and blood, them pans ached with the fearful noise
the animals made.</p>

<p>Josiah wanted the worst way to go to the Parliament
of Cogers, which wuz established over two
hundred years ago, and still meets in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “A public man in America naterly
depends on cogers and sech for his election.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I; “Heaven knows that is so.
Saloon-keepers and whiskey and beer and cider
manafacturers, and whiskey drinkers, and the raw
foreign element, and other cogers, elect more politicians
to office, specially in our big towns, than any
other element; and pure men and Christian
wimmen have to stand back and be ruled by ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, blandly; “and so it stands anybody
in hand who has political aspirations and
wants to be popular with the masses to ingrashiate
himself with all the cogers he can. I would love
to see what means these men take to endear themselves
to the cogers, besides buyin’ ’em, and makin’
’em drunk, and sech other ways as I’m familar
with.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “you’ll go alone for all of me; I
see cogers enough in my own country without
huntin’ ’em up here, and I’d advise you to keep
away from ’em.” Sez I, “Your head hain’t strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>enough, Josiah, to hold only jest so much, and I’d
advise you to fill it up with the noble and grand
objects we see here on every side, and let cogers
alone.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “my futer depends on ’em; I
must keep up with other statesmen if I’m ever to
amount to anything.”</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t listen to any more of his arguments,
and waved off the subject almost hautily.</p>

<p>But I found out afterwards that the Parliament
wuzn’t cogers as Josiah looked on ’em, and they
wuz particular to be called <i>co</i>gers, with the emphasis
on the <i>co</i>. I found they wuz a sort of mock
debates&mdash;patronized by lawyers, political men,
newspaper men, clerks, etc., where they debate on
every subject, and drink beer and smoke pipes and
talk, talk, talk.</p>

<p>Daniel O’Connell and Curran and John Wilkes
and many others eminent in debate wuz members
of this club.</p>

<p>I had always pictered the Tower of London as a
tall tower a-shootin’ up, some like a steeple, only
more of a size all the way up; more, mebby,
like a very tall pillow. But, anyway, I’d always
depictered it in my mind as steeple or pillow
shaped.</p>

<p>But, to my surprise, I found that what is called the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>Tower of London is a hull lot of buildin’s that
cover nigh upon fourteen acres of ground, though
there are, of course, a number of towers throwed in&mdash;thirteen
of ’em in all&mdash;Bloody Tower, Bell
Tower, Jewel Tower, etc., etc. They date back to
the time of Cæsar.</p>

<p>There wuz a Roman fortress on this spot when
the Romans held London. One tower is called
Cæsar’s Tower now. William the Conqueror
founded the Tower of London as we see
it. When he wuz alive it wuz a great palace,
with thick walls for safety or defence; it
wuz used as a prison for prisoners of state mostly,
and now it is used as an arsenal. Piles of rifles
and cannons are kep’ here in some of the buildin’s.</p>

<p>The principal entrance is the Lion’s Gate, but
there are three other gates. The Traitor’s Gate wuz
the one through which prisoners wuz took into the
Tower. I don’t spoze they recognized the way they
wuz took out. Then there is the Water Gate and
the Iron Gate.</p>

<p>One of the most interestin’ sights there wuz the
guards who had charge of the place. They had on
velvet hats, with a kind of a wreath on ’em, some
like Tirzah Ann’s last winter’s hat, and a deep ruffle
round their necks, and a blue sort of a polenay or
overskirt, with a belt all embroidered with roses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>and thistles and shamrocks and crowns, and, etc., and
short pantoloons, with stockin’s comin’ up to the
knee, and rosettes on their knees and rosettes on
their shues.</p>

<p>Josiah sez to me, “Never before sence I wuz
born have I seen a man dressed up as he ort to be
to carry out my idees. You can see for yourself,
Samantha, jest how perfectly beautiful, and how
dressy and stylish a man can be if he sets out;
why,” sez he, “a dress like that would take twenty
years offen my age, and I d’no but twenty-one,
and I’m bound to have one jest exactly like it
if I ever live to git home. What a sensation it will
create in Jonesville!” sez he dreamily.</p>

<p>I gin a deep sithe, but before I could reply the
company started on their rounds of observation,
led by one of them gay-dressed individuals. They
go the rounds every half hour.</p>

<p>Wall, we got some guide-books, and payed our
sixpence apiece for our tickets, some as if we wuz
goin’ into a menagerie, and follered the guide over
the moat bridge into the different towers.</p>

<p>Martin and Josiah wuz dretful interested in the
place where the weepons wuz kep’, bayonets and
swords and rifles and pistols enough to equip all the
armies of the earth, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>But I wuz more interested, a dretful heart-sickenin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>interest in the place where the wretched
captives wuz imprisoned and wore the long hours
away (jest as long hours as we have now) in vain
dreams of the happy and brilliant past. A-lookin’
forred to the sure approach of a awful death, or,
perhaps, in ellusive hopes of escape and flight to
other shores.</p>

<p>But the shores they reached, poor things! wuz
up a steep the livin’ has never climbed.</p>

<p>We see on the walls of these prisons words they
carved in the hours they waited execution. Arthur
Poole, who tried to help Mary up onto the English
throne, left these words&mdash;</p>

<p>“I. H. S. A passage perillus makethe a port
pleasant&mdash;1568.&mdash;A. Poole.”</p>

<p>I wonder jest how he felt when he writ them
words&mdash;jest what a heartache and heartbreak spoke
through ’em. I dare presoom to say he thought
too much of Mary, but I can’t help that now; it’s
three hundred years too late.</p>

<p>There wuz elaborate carvin’s of flowers, leaves,
figgers, etc., and the names of their unhappy designers,
who seemin’ly tried to light up their
captivity by formin’ the shapes of the flowers
they would never see a-growin’ in freedom agin&mdash;poseys
without perfume, cold stun rosys, indeed.</p>

<p>And then in one room wuz jest that one word:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Jane.”</p>
</div>

<p>That touched me more’n the more elaborate
ones. That wuz spozed to mean Lady Jane Grey,
and wuz carved by her pardner, Lord Dudley. It
seemed as if Love wuz a-callin’ out to her&mdash;“Jane!”
jest that one cry acrost the silences of death and
eternity.</p>

<p>Then there wuz the autograph of Philip Howard,
Earl of Arundel, who had his head cut off in 1572
for wantin’ to marry Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>What a havock that woman did make amongst
the men!</p>

<p>Then in the White Tower we see the place where
Essex wuz killed and the rooms occupied by Sir
Walter Raleigh, and in the Brick Tower we see the
prison where Walter spent the last days of his life.
I wondered if through the long, dreary hours them
real good words of hisen wuz any comfort to him:</p>

<p>Them lines ort to have been a comfort to him&mdash;mebby
they wuz. But lines writ in a pleasant room
to home, with the door shet up, don’t mebby sound
jest the same on the scaffold or to the stake&mdash;dretful
echoes sound all round ’em, loud voices that
mebby drown out the words.</p>

<p>I spoze he thought sometimes durin’ them long
days of his friends Shakespeare and Bacon. Mebby
if there wuz any secrets between them two about
the plays, he knew it. I wish I knew what it wuz&mdash;I’d
give fifty cents freely if it could be made
known to me.</p>

<p>I wonder what he thought of Elizabeth in them
days. I wonder if he wuz sorry he throwed his
cloak down for her to walk over. He tried to keep
her from jest dampenin’ her feet a little, and she
willin’ to cut his head off.</p>

<p>I’ll bet if he’d had his way them last ten days
here, he would have let her sloshed right through
the mud, and not offered to throw his cloak down
for her.</p>

<p>Poor, capricious, jealous creeter, Lib wuz; but I
believe that big collar she always wore choked her
and kinder rasped her neck, and made her ugly. It
would make me cross as a bear, it seems to me.</p>

<p>But I d’no what his feelin’s wuz, nor what hern
wuz, when she knew the man who wuz once her
lover, and beloved by her, wuz spendin’ the long
days alone with despair and death.</p>

<p class="h2sub">PARIS AND ITS BEAUTIES.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin felt and sed that France must be
took in by him. He sed that a full knowledge of
the French character, the
country and the customs
and habits of the people,
wuz positively imperative
to any one who laid any
claims to fashion, and so
he laid out to go to France
and give it a exhaustive
study. He laid out, he
sed, to stay in the country
not less than three
days, and he might possibly
stay four.</p>

<p>Thinkses I, with a deep
inward sithe, I guess it
will be a exhaustive study;
it exhausted me even to
think of bein’ raced so through a country, whirled
on by the influence of Fashion and Martin.</p>

<p>But he wuz the conductor of the enterprise, so to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
speak, and we had to foller his rules blindly, as it wuz.</p>

<p>Wall, travellin’ at the rate of speed we did, my
memories are apt to run together, some like the
colors of a calico dress after it is washed&mdash;the blacks
and reds are apt to mingle, dark eppisodes and
lighter complected ones&mdash;but some memories stand
out vividly, too deeply printed to fade out.</p>

<p>One is my Josiah’s feelin’s at not havin’ his breakfast
till ’leven o’clock.</p>

<p>In vain the waiter told him that at any time he
could have his “calf-o-lay” (French).</p>

<p>“Lay!” sez he; “that’s jest what I want to get rid
on&mdash;lay! Do you spoze that after gittin’ up at five
o’clock all my life, I’m a-goin’ to lay abed till noon?”
And then the waiter murmured sunthin’ agin about
“calf-o-lay.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowp59" id="i_486" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_486.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“Calf-o-lay! I hain’t a calf or a ox!” he shouted.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And that madded Josiah agin, and sez he, “What
of it&mdash;what if calves do lay! I hain’t a calf or a
ox!” he shouted. “You think,” sez he, “that because
I come from the country that you can go on
with your insultin’ talk about calves, and intimate
that I’m a calf. But I’ll let you know that you’ve got
holt of the wrong individual to impose upon. Keep
your dum breakfast till noon if you want to and
starve a man to death, but you shall not call me a
calf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span></p>

<p>I interrupted him and told him that he meant
coffee with milk.</p>

<p>“Coffee and milk!” he hollered; “what is that to
feed a starvin’ man?” Sez he, “I want pork and
beans and potaters and slap-jacks.”</p>

<p>Wall, the waiter wuz skairt most to death, but I
quieted my pardner down, and the next time I had
a chance I bought two paper bags of cookies and
sech, to appease the worst cravin’s of hunger, and
administered ’em to him as I had need.</p>

<p>Another memory is seein’ the bathers goin’ in at
Havre, and the trials I had with my pardner a-keepin’
him out of the briny surf.</p>

<div class="figright illowp50" id="i_489" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_489.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">How stylish I would look.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sez he, “Samantha, I will go in a-bathin’; jest
see,” sez he, “how gayly they swim and float
through the water, all dressed up in bright colors;
how stylish it would look, what a air it would gin
us to see you and me a-floatin’ and a-bobbin’ up and
down in that element! It would be sunthin’ so uneek
to tell to Deacon Gowdey and Ury.</p>

<p>“And then,” sez he, “we could lead the fashion
to home, we could turn the buzz saw-mill dam into
a perfect carnival of delight.”</p>

<p>I looked coldly at him, and sez I, “You’re not
goin’ to make a fool of yourself at your age by bathin’
and foolin’ round in the water.”</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “you’re always preachin’ up bathin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>to me; you’ve lectered me more times than I’ve
got fingers and toes about bathin’; and now that I’m
willin’ to foller it up, you draw me back.”</p>

<p>And agin he looked longin’ly at the dancin’ surf
and the gay-robed bathers and the
funny bathin’ housen.</p>

<p>But I sez, “A big pail of water
and some soap and towels and
the seclusion of your bedroom are
very different from makin’ a spectacle
of yourself here in this hant
of display.”</p>

<p>I broke it up.</p>

<p>And then at Trouville, though
I spoze nobody would believe it,
and he denies it now, yet sech is
the force of custom and fashion on
the mind of my beloved pardner
that I d’no but that man would
have played cards and won money
mebby up as high as 25 cents, if
I’d allowed it.</p>

<p>He denies the awful charge, and mebby he’s right.
But he talked strange, strange for a deacon and a
grandfather.</p>

<p>But while engaged in these purile thoughts while
journeyin’ through France his pardner wuz thinkin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>of what we owed the country, and how it sent the
flower of its youth and bravery to help us in our
troublous time.</p>

<p>I thought of the young Marquis De Lafayette
leavin’ his fair France, his ease, his luxury, and his
sweetheart, to sail out fur away into the midst of
privations and dangers to help a strugglin’ colony
to independence.</p>

<p>And then I thought of how another Frenchman,
Jacques Cartier, wuz the first white man to navigate
our king of rivers, the St. Lawrence. Why, my
thoughts soared and sailed along as I thought of
them idees, most as surgin’ and deep as that noble
river at its widest pint, and my pride and glory in
my native land stood up above that sweepin’ current
some like its Thousand Islands, only mebby not
ornamented off so much as they be with palaces,
bridges, cupalos, torchlights, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But I felt dretful riz up. And a-musin’ on Lafayette
and the debt we owed France, I wondered if
they got in a tussel with England or Russia or etc.&mdash;if
Uncle Sam would lay to and help her in
return.</p>

<p>But I d’no as there is any danger of our havin’
the job, seein’ she has got about six millions of defenders
in her army and navy; and we about 20 or
30 thousand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span></p>
<p>Queer, hain’t it, when the United States is so
much bigger than she is?</p>

<p>But the fact speaks well for our republic and all
the law-makers, from its President and Governors
down to its Pathmasters and School Trustees.</p>

<p>In Havre, Alice wuz some interested in seein’
the birthplace of Sara Bernhardt. She had seen
her act, and they do say, though she is considerable
bony in figger and gittin’ along in years, she is a
marvel of grace, and acts out all sorts of lives, and
dies so nateral that you’d almost appint the day for
her funeral and pick out her barriers.</p>

<p>I don’t spoze I could ever git to be nigh so
graceful as she is, and Josiah don’t think I can; he
wuz real sot on it when we talked it over.</p>

</div>

<p>Al Faizi wuz interested in seein’ the birthplace of
Alphonse Karr&mdash;he had read his works.</p>

<p>Wall, there wuz one place I wanted to see dretfully
on our journey to Paris, and Al Faizi and
Alice wanted to see it too. And that wuz the
place where the Maid of Orleans wuz executed in
1431. I mentioned to Martin our desires.</p>

<p>And he sez, “Joan of Ark? What Ark,” sez he,
“is that? I am not familiar with any such personage,” sez
he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “You can call her that, or you can call her
Jennie Dark; you can call it either way.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span></p>
<p>“I don’t know any Ark or Dark,” sez he.
“Was she a woman of any note? Was her calling a
high one?” sez he.</p>

<p>“About as high as you git here below,” sez I.
“She heard voices from above; angels talked with
her and guided her on her way.” And I went on
and related her history, brief though impressive,
comin’ to me through Thomas J.</p>

<p>Sez Martin, “I don’t approve of following up
any such impostors; I don’t believe in any such
doings. Common sense don’t bear them out.”</p>

<p>Sez I mildly, “Mebby Oncommon Sense is
needed to comprehend it, Martin.”</p>

<p>But he wuz obdurate, till Alice told him in
her sweet way that she would really love to go
there.</p>

<p>And then he gin in to once.</p>

<p>And we did go to the Place De Pucelle, where
she wuz burned to death for bein’ more speritual and
riz up than her burners.</p>

<p>I had a sight of emotions as I stood on that spot&mdash;sights
on ’em.</p>

<p>You see, I had her story at my tongue’s end,
Thomas J. had read it to me so much. She wuz a
common country girl, whose parents wuz day
laborers. She herself couldn’t read or write. Into
this sile, prepared, as you may say&mdash;speakin’ from the
laws of heredity&mdash;for only coarse labor, coarse
thoughts, common desires and hopes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span></p>

<p>In this sile sprung up the consummit flower of
speritual communion. Angels talked with her.
She held communion with the Exalted One.
From her thirteenth year she heard voices speakin’
to her. They did not tell her to go forth to labor
like her brothers and sisters; no, they told her to
free France from the English, put her young king
on the throne. The onseen one that talked with
her enabled her to know her troubled young king,
amidst a crowd of his own age and dressed jest as
he wuz.</p>

<p>She had hard work to even see him to tell her
mission, so sure wuz the Common Sense about her
that the Oncommon Sense she had wuz only imposter.</p>

<p>But she headed the army, made that wicked, dissolute
body of soldiers some like Christian Endeavorers,
so ardent and sincere wuz her piety.</p>

<p>She won the battle. Agin and agin she defeated
the enemy. She saw her young king crowned.
Then she wanted to go back into her quiet home&mdash;into
the garden where in the cool of the evenin’ she
heard the heavenly message. She said her work
wuz done. But they wouldn’t let her go. And
wuz it because she didn’t foller the Voice that told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>her to go back to her old home&mdash;did a little personal
pride, gratified ambition, ozze in and flavor
the human mandate to make her stay?</p>

<p>I d’no, nor Josiah don’t. But she begun to make
mistakes after this&mdash;lost battles, and at last her
own countrymen, though allies of the English,
called her a sorceress. The Common Sense found
her guilty; the same C. S. burnt her up root and
branch.</p>

<p>But the Oncommon Sense didn’t desert her.
The heavenly influence that the multitude wuz
blind as a bat to, and as deef as a adder, made her
say in them last supreme moments&mdash;</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> hear the voices.”</p>

<p>Wall, the feelin’s I had as I stood in that spot
couldn’t be counted&mdash;no, not on a typewriter.</p>

<p>The Common Sense felt that a statute to her ort
to be useful, as well as ornamental, so they made it
into a sort of a waterin’ trough. And the statute
hain’t what it ort to be, but my imagination filled
out the details, and I see as I look at it the rapt face
of the little maiden of thirteen a-lookin’ up with
illumined eyes as she received the message; I see
her a noble conqueror, clad in armor, stand by her
young king as she see him crowned; I see her
noble face uplifted to Heaven as the flames
mounted about her; I hearn her say&mdash;</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> hear the voices.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span></p>

<p>But my reflections wuz cut short by the words:</p>

<p>“Well, I believe tourists usually make a short
stay here; it is comparatively uninteresting. This
combination of trough and monument is remarkably
uninteresting, and not to be copied by Americans.</p>

<p>“Though considering the small water power
France possesses, compared with our own great
water-courses, I can’t perhaps criticise their methods
so much.” This I heard on the right of me, then
on the left of me Josiah’s voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“This has put a crackin’ good idee into my head,
Samantha. You know the trough out east of the
horse barn, Ury might kinder chop out a statute
of me and nail it on top of it; it would be highly
esteemed by my fellow-townsmen. He could put
on it, you know, ”Deacon and salesman in the
cheese factory.“ They’d praise the trough highly,
and I’ll have Ury begin it jest as quick as I git
home; I’ve got a good block of hickory over to the
saw-mill.”</p>

<p>I sithed deep and turned away, and I see Al
Faizi’s rapt face a-lookin’ beyend the statute&mdash;fur
beyend, on sunthin’ that Martin and Josiah couldn’t
see if they lived to be as old as Metheuseleah.</p>

<p>Alice looked real sweet and dreamy, too. Adrian
wuz playin’ in the water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span></p>
<p>And so each one on us wuz pursuin’ our own
peticular fantoms, some on ’em as thin shadders as
the materials dreams are made of, and some on ’em
as real and practical as horse-blocks and anvils.</p>

<p>Martin sed he should make only a brief visit to
France, as he had studied the country so exhaustively
when he brung Alice over here to school and
went after her (in all, he wuz in France about 48
hours); he sed he could spend but very little
time there.</p>

<p>But he sed that he felt that the proper thing to
do would be to visit Paris, so he could say on our
return that we had come straight from Paris. I
d’no why he felt so, but I spoze he did.</p>

<p>But we did, indeed, find Paris a beautiful city.</p>

<p>Martin put up at a first-class tarvern, as he always
did. But I hearn him tell Josiah that they cheated
him on every side. It madded Martin, for though
he always duz things on a large, noble scale, and is
willin’ to pay large, yet he don’t want to be cheated&mdash;nobody
duz.</p>

<p>I found that they spoke English at the tarvern, so
my worst fears wuz squenched; for how I wuz goin’
to git along and feed Josiah in a land where bread
wuz “pain” and water wuz “oh” wuz more than I
could tell. Besides, other things accordin’, what
wuz I to do? I wildly questioned my soul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span></p>
<p>How could I git my pardner dressed, and warmed,
and git him from place to place wuz more than
I could tell; but my fears wuz vain, for though
jabberin’s wuz on every side on us, and rapid vocifiration
in senseless brogue wuz in voge, yet plenty wuz
found who spoke our good, honest, Jonesville tongue.</p>

<p>How clean Paris is! how gay and bright the
streets look! what pretty wimmen, and what neat,
smart-lookin’ men, and pretty children, too, with
their smart nurse-maids! elegant carriages, splendid
housen, magnificent buildin’s, and arches, and towers,
and monuments, and meetin’-housen, and around
everything and over everything the gay, bright atmosphere
of good feelin’ and politeness.</p>

<p>No wonder folks love to come here, and don’t
want to go away. Why, I enjoyed myself first-rate
in Paris, and Paris enjoyed my bein’ there, so
fur as I know; they acted as if they did, anyway;
most always a-smilin’ at me and my pardner in a
most agreeable manner.</p>

<p>Yes, they wuz glad we had lanched out and come,
I hain’t a doubt on’t.</p>

<p>Alice had lots of school friends here, and wuz
out a good deal a-seein’ ’em, and Martin and Al
Faizi wuz each on ’em a-pursuin’ their own favorite
fantoms&mdash;as different as any two fantoms ever wuz,
from first to last.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span></p>
<p>But Josiah and me shacked round quite a good
deal, Adrian a-goin’ with us quite considerable.
About the first thing that strikes you as you venter
out-doors is the wideness and beauty of the
streets, with their double row of trees and their elegant
housen, lookin’ so sort o’ finished&mdash;not put in
anyhow, like a palace and a hovel, but all kinder
of the same style and make, handsome as picters,
and the sidewalk is as wide as from our house to
the barn, and I d’no but wider. They are
twice as wide as the main street in Zoar, some on
’em, where they have the most gay and beautiful
stores of different kinds; and, if you’ll believe it,
they have tables set out-doors in the most handsome
style, and folks a-eatin’ at ’em, all dressed up
and a-jabberin’ away, and a-laughin’, and havin’ a
first-rate time.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz dretful impressed by it all.</p>

<p>Sez he, as if he wuz a-usin’ real big words, sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>“France is impressive and edifyin’ in many ways.
What improvements we can witness and inaugerate
to home! One thing I shall immegiately proceed to
arrange; henceforth, Samantha, we shall always
partake of our food out by the side of the road.”</p>

<p>I looked real cold at the idee, and he went on&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Josiah, “cultered and travelled,” schemes for Jonesvillian out-door
dinner parties, à la Paris, and how Samantha foresees the result.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Jest think of the gayety, the life it will bring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>to Jonesville to have all the neighbors a-eatin’ out
by the highway, for of course they will foller the
example of those who are cultered and travelled;
imagine,” sez he, a-wavin’ his hand and enjoyin’
himself first-rate in futer retrospects ahead on
him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Imagine Deacon Henzy and Drusilly, and she
that wuz Submit Tewksbury and her husband, Simon
Slimpsey and Betsy, all on ’em a-eatin’ out-doors,
a-minglin’ their voices with ourn as we set
to our table; I with my dressin’-gown on, and you,
if you wanted to, a-playin’ on a accordeon in a gay,
light manner befittin’ the happy occasion.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “It would be a lot of fun to set down in a
lot of burdocks and mullin full of dirt; and what
would happen when Deacon Small driv his big herd
of cows by? You know they always will go a-prancin’
and a-kickin’ up the dust and a-actin’ because
he wants ’em to eat the grass along the side of the
road.</p>

<p>“How would you like to have the table overturned
by his critters, and you prostrated by a
kick in the stumick as you tried vainly to protect
the teapot? How would you like to have that
Jersey entangle his huffs in the tossels of your
dressin’-gown, and drag you at his heels?” sez I.</p>

<p>“And who’d bring the food out there and bear it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>in agin? And if you think I’m a-goin’ to learn the
accordeon at my age and with my rumatiz, you’re
mistakened.”</p>

<p>He see it wuzn’t feasible, but he wouldn’t gin in.</p>

<p>He drawed my attention off by pintin’ down the
magnificent vista of broad avenues, three hundred
feet wide, smooth as glass, and full of gay vehicles,
and beyend, risin’ up like a dream of beauty and
grandeur and strength, the great Arch d’Etoile.</p>

<p>This can never be described by Josiah or me; it
must be seen to be appreciated. It is the grandest
monument Napoleon has left, and cost over two
millions of dollars.</p>

<p>But as you go on you see fountains and columns
and gardens and arches and booths and groves and
singers and amusements of all kinds for the people,
and everything else that is beautiful and impressive
and etc., etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Place Vendôme, where memories of the
great king-maker hover round the tall columns
that picters out his grand, melancholy career;
the Tuileries and the Louvre.</p>

<p>How be I a-goin’ to make the public and Betsy
Slimpsey git any idee of them palaces, adorned
with all that is most beautiful in art and sculpter,
and that cover sixty acres of ground!</p>

<p>Mebby I could gin Drusilly Henzy a little idee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>on’t, for that is jest the number of acres of solid
ground that fell onto ’em from her father.</p>

<p>It jest about crushed ’em&mdash;the wealth seemed
to ’em overwhelmin’.</p>

<p>Imagine a big farm all risin’ up into palaces,
beautiful as you ever see rise up into the cloudy
Heavens.</p>

<p>The Gallery of the Louvre&mdash;wall, if Drusilly and
I should undertake to pick up every little grain of
dirt that goes to make up them sixty acres of hern,
and have each separate one branch out into some
beautiful, be-a-u-tiful form, some delicate, exquisite
fancy, or some exalted figger of impressive beauty&mdash;why,
wouldn’t we be tuckered out before we
got through? though at the same time so riz up
and inspired, that we wouldn’t know, some of
the time, whether we wuz in the body or out on’t.</p>

<p>Wall, that may gin the public and Betsy some
idee of what everybody must make up their mind
to go through when they tackle the Louvre.</p>

<p>From the beginnin’ of time till now every land
has contributed its choicest treasures to this hallowed
place, from Nineveh and Egypt to Jonesville
(for was not Jonesville’s choicest treasures of
humanity represented there when Josiah Allen and
I stood there, some like statutes, only more comfortably
dressed, and lookin’ round us more?).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span></p>
<p>What poems in marble bust onto our visions,
and what sights on ’em!</p>

<p>What marvels of ancient art!</p>

<p>What picters! what picters!</p>

<p>Oh, dear me! it lifts me up, and tuckers me out
to think on ’em now. Some of the galleries wuz a
quarter of a mild long.</p>

<p>Jest think of it here, as fur as from our
house over to Old Grout Nickleson’s; and I
never ust to think, when his mother-in-law was
bed-rid, that I could walk it; no, I always had
Josiah hitch up. And then think of that immense
distance full on each side of the best of
the world.</p>

<p>Picters by Guido, Murillo, Titian, Rembrandt,
Vandyke, Leonardo da Vinci, Wouverman, etc.,
etc., etc.&mdash;picters that them immortal old masters
had their own hands on, and bent their own glowin’
inspired eyes on.</p>

<p>My soul, jest think on’t!</p>

<p>Relicks of all the sovereigns&mdash;spurs of the old
conquerors (and how they did spur things up and
make ’em fly!).</p>

<p>Relicks of kings without number&mdash;and queens,
too, and princes.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette’s shues&mdash;I’m glad I didn’t have
to walk in ’em, for though they trod through pleasant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>luxurious places at first, they had to climb up
the scaffold.</p>

<p>Poor creeter!</p>

</div>

<p>The Napoleon Room gin me a sight of emotions,
and I didn’t care who see ’em.
I jest about cried when I looked
on that old flag he kissed in a
sad hour. There wuz the clothes
he wore that he ust to button
over that restless, ambitious
heart. Yes, and there wuz some
of the hair that riz up over that
ambitious brain, that wuz the
terror and admiration of all
Europe.</p>

<p>He used Josephine mean&mdash;mean
as a dog, and he
wuz too high-sperited and
ambitious; but yet what
a man, what a man he
wuz! Sunthin’ good and
noble must have been in
him to make his soldiers
love him so. How they totter up to-day to lay
wreaths on the railin’ round his statute&mdash;layin’
at his marble feet the poseys of their hearts’ devotion,
their highest love, and their deepest sorrer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>No man not naterally noble could call forth sech
affection in his dependents.</p>

<p>I have wished a hundred times I could have been
there, and neighbored with him and Josephine, and
kinder kep’ ’em together, and quelled him down
some in his ambitious views&mdash;things would have
been different, no doubt; I presoom she wouldn’t
have died of a broken heart&mdash;years in dyin’, but so
much the harder.</p>

<p>He wouldn’t have had to be shet up in a lonesome
island a prisoner, and all Europe would have
fared better.</p>

<p>But it wuzn’t to be&mdash;it wuzn’t to be.</p>

<p>Pa Smith at that time wuzn’t married, and
I wuz&mdash;wall, I don’t really know where I wuz
at that time, nor Josiah don’t know; it looked
kinder dubersome and vague about my ever bein’
born at all, and things had to go on jest as they
did.</p>

<p>Wall, as I have said heretofore, that gallery of
the Louvre is full, full to overflowin’ of the richest
treasures of art, as my riz-up brain and my
four weary legs testify&mdash;my own two extremities
and my Josiah’s pair on ’em.</p>

<p>Hisen ached like the toothache, so he sed.</p>

<p>He didn’t bear his weariness silently and oncomplainin’ly,
as I tried to&mdash;no, with groanin’s that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>couldn’t be uttered hardly he kep’ by my side
through them interminable galleries.</p>

<p>Adrian asked a sight of questions&mdash;a sight of
’em. And when I proposed to go to the Bois
de Boulogne, my poor pardner asked me feelin’ly
if in the name of the gracious Peter I wanted
another boy a-traipsin’ at our heels a-askin’ enough
questions to tire out a regiment of soldiers.</p>

<p>But I explained it all out to him, and we took
considerable comfort there.</p>

<p>The place wuz more beautiful than tongue
could tell. Jest as a French woman always looks
better dressed up than an American or an English
woman, and their cities more brilliant and
beautiful, jest so are these woods fur more beautiful
than Jonesville or New York woods.</p>

<p>Why, jest compare our sugar bush and the
woods between Zoar and Jonesville with these
woods of Boulogne&mdash;where be they? Further off
than the golden sunset is to the vision of Josiah.</p>

<p>And the Elysian Fields&mdash;tongue would fail to
give any idee of what we see there.</p>

<p>Notre Dame, perfect indeed duz it look, a-risin’
up with its two towers a-dwarfin’ the housen about
it, though they are sizable ones.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Obelisk of Luxor, that rises up
in the air one hundred feet, all full of strange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>writin’, I wish it could speak and tell what it
had seen all through the past centuries&mdash;what its
old red face must have looked down on from first
to last.</p>

<p>Curous to even think on. I presoom it must
have looked down on Cleopatra and seen her a-cuttin’
up and a-actin’, a-flirtin’ and a-carryin’ matters
altogether too fur with Antony, Cæsar, etc., etc.</p>

<p>I wonder if the old obelisk sees any sech doin’s
now in Paris in 1894?</p>

<p>I dare presoom to say she duz. Human nater
has always capered sence the days of Adam and
Eve.</p>

<p>It hain’t never talked on much, but I always
blamed Antony jest as much as I did Cleopatra and
Cæsar too; they all ort to been ashamed of themselves&mdash;and
sech good wives as they had, too.
Aurelia and Calpurnia wuz real good wimmen, so
fur as I ever hearn on.</p>

<p>Wall, the big fountain, which stood not fur off,
are a sight to see and are ornamented beautifully,
besides havin’ immense water priveliges, and they
ort to have, for right here on this spot stood
that dretful thing, the guillotine.</p>

<p>Oh, what doin’s, what doin’s took place right
here! Angels must have veiled their faces with
their feather wings as they flew over the spot in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>them dretful days of the French Revolution.
Twenty-eight hundred wuz killed here&mdash;had their
heads cut right off&mdash;trompled on by men risin’ aginst
tyrants, killin’ ’em off; and then they, too, turned
into tyrants, wuz overthrown and killed off like
sheep.</p>

<p>Louis XVI., Charlotte Corday, Marie Antoinette,
Danton, Robespierre&mdash;oh, what dretful things to
think on! But the murmur of the water as it
spouted up and fell back in murmurs whispered of
happier, more peaceful times.</p>

<p>In a place where stood the old prison of Bastille,
a sile steeped with the tears and blood of the
thousand and thousands of prisoners and victims,
stands Liberty, a-standin’ upon a monument one
hundred and fifty feet high. She always had to
wade through blood, and always will, for all I
know. She had a broken chain in one hand&mdash;the
past is behind her, the chains are broke. She lifts
up a torch in the other hand, its light streams into
the futer. She don’t lay out to have any more
sech deeds of darkness done if she can possibly
help it&mdash;you can see that by the looks of her.</p>

<p class="h2sub">NAPOLEON AND OTHER GREAT FRENCHMEN.</p>

<p>One day I told Josiah that I must go to see the
Invalides.</p>

<p>And he sez, “You better keep away, Samantha;
you may ketch sunthin’.”</p>

<p>But I explained that I wanted to see the tomb of
Napoleon, so he gin in, and we went there and stayed
some time.</p>

<p>The big gilded dome of this meetin’-house towers
up three hundred and fifty feet, and can be seen all
over the city, and would be apt to keep Napoleon
in memory if France wuz inclined to forgit him,
which it hain’t. Here he lays, jest as he wanted to,
by the banks of the waters he thought so much on,
and with the French people he loved.</p>

<p>As you go in, you see under a gold and white canopy
the form of our Lord upon the cross lookin’ down,
down into a splendid tomb surrounded by a great laurel
crown and twelve giant statutes of Victories a-towerin’
up all about it&mdash;you see the grave of the Great
Conqueror. My emotions wuz a sight to behold; I
couldn’t count ’em, nor did Josiah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span></p>
<p>All the thoughts I had ever had about the Hero&mdash;and
they’d been soarin’ ones and a endless variety
on ’em seemin’ly&mdash;all seemed to be crystallized and
run together as I stood in that spot. But how could
I tell my feelin’s? I couldn’t no more’n them
twelve marble figgers could, who lifted their grand
colossial figgers all round his coffin; their great
noble faces expressed a sight, and so I spoze
mine did, but it would have been jest as vain
for me to have told my emotions as it would
for them to open their marble lips and told
theirn.</p>

<p>You might probble thought that they had their
own idees about Napoleon, and so had I.</p>

<p>He waded through seas of blood and sufferin’,
personal sufferin’ as well, up from obscurity to the
topmost pinnacle of worldly glory. He left achin’,
bleedin’ hearts on all sides on him, from Josephine’s
down to the widders and sweethearts of dead soldiers,
as he stalked along with his arms folded, and that old
hat of hisen on, and his inscrutable eyes fixed on the
heights, so I spoze; but he loved his country, and
there wuz sunthin’ about the man that drew hearts
to him, that turned grizzled old soldiers into babies
when they spoke on him, that made ’em willin’ to
live for him, to die for him.</p>

<p>I felt queer.</p>

<p>But Martin could not pause long even in this
place, and for all I know all the while we wuz there
he wuz a-pricein’ in his mind the marble and porphry
and all the matchless splendor of the tomb, and
a-calculatin’ on how much the money invested there
would bring if he had the handlin’ of it. Anyway,
we wuz probble milds and milds apart in our minds,
though the left tab of my mantilly brushed aginst
him.</p>

<p>Josiah observed as we turned away that he wuz
“hungry and dog tired.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi wuz deep in thought, and Alice and
Adrian took up in lookin’ about ’em, and wonderin’
at the grand and solemn magnificence of the interior.</p>

<p>One day we went to the cemetery of Père La
Chaise. Alice and Al Faizi and Adrian went with
us that day; Martin had got to go to see some big
man or other, who owned a ranch in Montana, in
the neighborhood of some of Martin’s friends.</p>

<p>Wall, what a quiet, lovely spot that cemetery is,
what a sweet place to rest in when our little life
here is rounded by a sleep!</p>

<p>Over two hundred acres of graves&mdash;what glowin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>hopes and joys, what miseries and despairs found
a rest here! Wealth and Poverty, Ambition and
Love, all asleep.</p>

<p>Rothschild a-droppin’ his money bags as the sleep
come on, as well as the baby who reposes under
the simple stun marked&mdash;“Our Own Darling
Baby.”</p>

<p>Hearts ached when he dropped to sleep.</p>

<p>The Countess Demidoff rests under the costly
Mausoleum built above her. And Rachel, the
great actress, wonderful creeter, how she moved the
hearts of the world! But at last the curtain fell and
she retired. No <i>encore</i> from friend or lover can
call her before the World’s footlights agin&mdash;no, she
has got through actin’; has gone from the Make-Believe
into the Real.</p>

<p>Talma, too, has gone to sleep in that quiet place,
and Béranger and Racine and Bernardin St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as though Paul and Virginia ort
to be here by him.</p>

<p>And La Place and Arago. I wonder if they
hain’t havin’ a good time up amongst the stars; I
presoom they have discovered lots of new worlds&mdash;hosts
of ’em. And General Massena, Marshal
Davoust, and Marshal Ney, the bravest soldier. And
Chopin, what music that man must have hearn by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>this time&mdash;more melogious than he ever dreamt on
here!</p>

<p>And Alice wanted to visit the graves of Abelard
and Heloise. They are restin’ under a canopy,
havin’ got past all the tribulations that beset ’em
here below.</p>

<p>Alice wanted to see ’em for Love’s sake&mdash;so I
spoze. Poor creeters that thought so much of each
other and seemed to be so clost to each other that
nothin’ earthly could separate ’em, and then he
a-dyin’ in a monastery and she a-passin’ away in a
nunnery; separated in body, but united in sperit&mdash;so
I spoze.</p>

<p>Wall, their memories are close linked together,
anyway, and will walk down the ages together.</p>

<p>Al Faizi’s dark eyes dwelt on Alice, and the marble
forms of the lovers, at about the same time and
for quite a long spell.</p>

<p>His look seemed to take ’em all in&mdash;Alice’s sweet
young beauty and the idee of the sad fate of the
lovers.</p>

<p>The hull sad story seemed to be writ out in his
melancholy, but glowin’ eyes.</p>

<p>Poor creeter!</p>

<p>Wall, Martin and Alice went to lots of places
that I hadn’t no idee of wantin’ to go to&mdash;receptions
and parties and theatres and sech. And Martin
come home from the theatre with his big feelin’s
kinder trompled down for once, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span></p>

<p>They wouldn’t let him in.</p>

<p>He probble could have bought out the hull theatre,
root and branch, and not felt it a mite; and to
home they would have strewed flowers in his path
up the aisle, if he had jest hinted at it.</p>

<p>But he wuz turned out here, neck and crop, because
he hadn’t a dress-suit on.</p>

<p>He felt meachin’ about it, I believe, though he
wouldn’t say much. But the next night they went
agin. He put on a coat with pinted tails and kinder
low necked in front, and they let him in quick as a
wink. Josiah said, when I told him about it, that
if he had known it he would have gin Martin the
loan of his dressin’-gown.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Of course that would’ve opened the doors
to once.</p>

<p>“The French love beauty, and that dressin’-gown,
when the tossels are combed out and looped up as
they ort to be, would set off any buildin’ and ornament
it.” Sez he, “I wouldn’t lend it on any common
occasion, but Martin has done so much for us
I would make the venter.”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t have been let in, but it showed Josiah’s
good sperit, anyway.</p>

<p>But, if you’ll believe it, Alice had to leave her
bunnet out in the anty-room and go in bare-headed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span></p>
<p>I wouldn’t have done it for nothin’ in the world&mdash;no,
you wouldn’t have ketched me a-reskin’ my bunnet
by leavin’ it out-doors. Why, the ribbin on
that bunnet cost twenty-five cents per yard, besides
the bunnet itself, and that wuz only four years old,
a-goin’ on five.</p>

<p>When Alice told me on it I sez, “It is a shame
to make wimmen go in bareheaded, and,” sez I,
“what would Paul say? He said it wuz a shame
for wimmen to appear in public without bunnets
on.”</p>

<p>“But I thought,” sez Josiah, “that you always
thought Paul wuz a-meddlin’ with what didn’t concern
him, and he’d better kep’ to morals and let millinery
business alone. You’d never let me bring up
them texts.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I impressively, “there is a time to
quote and a time not to quote.</p>

<p>“I should have argued with that doorkeeper, anyway,
and, if necessary, brung up the Bible to him.”</p>

<p>And Alice bought lots of fine things while we were
there&mdash;her Pa wanted her to. He bought a lot,
too.</p>

<p>He said that he could git the same things through
a dealer he knew in New York considerable cheaper,
“but,” sez he, “it doesn’t have the same name.
Anything brought from Paris is so dreadful distinguished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span></p>

<p>And I spozed that he wuz in the right on’t, and
I felt that I too would love to branch out and buy
sunthin’ that I could tell the neighbors come right
from Paris, France.</p>

<p>And I beset Josiah to buy me a summer
shawl, but he said that he’d seen my
summer shawl for so many years wropped
round the form he loved so, that the idee
of seein’ me in any other shawl wuz repugnant
to him.</p>

<p>Wall, then I laid to and tried to git him
to buy me a handkerchief pin; but he said
that old cameo that I had on looked so
beautiful. He said so many memories
hung round that shell face on it that he
couldn’t bear to see me with any other on.</p>

<p>And so it wuz with my winter bunnet. Sez he,
“Oh, the times I have seen that bunnet a-frontin’
up to me when I’ve stood by the meetin’-house
door a-waitin’ for you, and it looked so perfectly
lovely to me, as I stood there with cold legs and
I ketched sight on it a-hallowin’ your face round
as I see it a-comin’ towards me! No other bunnet
could ever look to me as that did.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span></p>
<p>And so with my shues, and my gloves, and every
other article; they wuz all so dear to him, and he
showed his affection to ’em and me so plain that I
couldn’t bear to hurt his feelin’s by gittin’ any new
ones.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>A-wipin’ my face on sech

</div>

<p>But I sez, “I need some towels, and have got to
have ’em.” So he give a reluctant consent, and I
swung out and bought two new huckabuck towels,
and I spoze Miss Gowdey and Sister Ganzey will
be surprised and sort of envious to see me a-wipin’
my face on sech genteel towels, brung from sech a
fashionable place, for I lay out to use ’em and not
lay ’em up&mdash;for, as the Sammist sez, slightly
changed&mdash;</p>

<p>“You may lay up towels, but how do you know
who shall gather ’em?”</p>

<p>Wall, when the time come for me to leave France
I felt bad, for besides all the reasons I have named,
lots of thoughts hovered over the land and made it
dretful interestin’ to me.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo, brave old exile, trompled on, but
like a rich flower, the tromplin’ brought out their
rarest odor.</p>

<p>Who knows whether we should ever had “Les
Miserables” if he had stayed to home and been made
much on?</p>

<p>Mebby the sentences of that incomparable book,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>that stun our minds and hearts, like the quick,
sharp echoes of artillery at sea&mdash;mebby they would
have been longer drawed out, and less apt to strike
the mark, if he hadn’t been sent into exile.</p>

<p>And Josephine, and Napoleon, and Louis, and
Eugenie, and the poor young Prince Louis&mdash;memories
of all on ’em jest walked up and down the
bright, beautiful streets with me, and cast a sort of
a melancholy shadder on the brightness, some like
the soft, deep shadders of a cypress-tree on a clean
flower-bed.</p>

<p>Yes, I had emotions enough while I wuz in
France, if that wuz all&mdash;I didn’t suffer for <i>them</i>&mdash;not
at all.</p>

<p>Martin, from the first to the last, through every
country we visited, drawed up comparisons between
’em and America&mdash;to the great advantage
to America.</p>

<p>He boasted over our country on our tower as
eloquent as a Fourth of July oriter ever did from
the wilds back of Loontown.</p>

<p>I hated to hear him callin’ every other country
all to nort, and told him so. And in the cause of
Duty I told him of several things these countries
went ahead of ourn in; but he waved ’em off, and
sez he, with a dignified sort of scorn:</p>

<p>“Bring up one, if you can.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span></p>
<p>“Wall,” sez I, a-lookin’ round on the inside of
my mind, and takin’ up the first idee that happened
to be in sight&mdash;“look at that great society, that
seems like the mission of angels, to help relieve the
wants of the wounded and dyin’ on the battle-field&mdash;the
Red Cross, the gleam of which, a-fallin’
on the dyin’ soldier, lights up his face with hope
and courage. The foreign nations protect that
insigna&mdash;they keep it sacred to this sacred cause;
while the Goverment of the United States allows
it to be used on liquor casks, and cigar boxes, and
etc., etc., a-trailin’ its glorious beams in the mud
and dirt for a little money.</p>

<p>“Why, the noble woman who stands a-holdin’ up
the Red Cross, a-tryin’ to have its pure rays fall
only on the victims of war, pestilence, famine, and
other national calamities&mdash;she has to see it a-shinin’
jest as bright on the causes of national crime and
shame. How must she feel to see it go on?</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam has been urged year after year to
protect this insigna, and I should think that he
would feel a good deal as if somebody wuz a-urgin’
him to not stun meetin’-housen, and whip grandmas
and babies&mdash;I should think that he would sink
down with shame for permittin’ sech things to go
on.</p>

<p>“I declare I d’no what that old creeter will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>do next. I believe he’d sell the steelyards that
Jestice weighs things in, if he could git a few cents
for ’em; and I d’no but he’ll use that bandage
of hern that she wears over her eyes to stop up
bung-holes in whiskey barrels; he seems to be
bendin’ his hull mind on helpin’ the liquor traffic.</p>

</div>

<p>“He tries me dretfully. But mebby he’ll brace
up and do right in this matter of the Red Cross.
I mean to tackle him about it, anyway, when I git
a good chance.</p>

<p>“And then,” sez I, “our country is jest as much
behind these European countries in beauty and art
as Josiah’s new wood lot is that he is jest a-clearin’
off, with stumps and brushwood a-lyin’ on every
side, compared with what that lot would be after
centuries of improvements and culter had
smoothed the ground off into velvet lawns, with
posey beds, like rainbows and fountains a-sparklin’
on it, etc., etc.</p>

<p>“America, to foller out the metafor, has only
jest got her giant trees chopped down&mdash;the stumps
stand thick, the brushwood lays round in fallers.”
Sez I, “It will take years and years and years to
give America the beauty and perfection these
countries have been growin’ gradual for centuries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span></p>
<p>“We’ll do it, Martin,” sez I; “we’ll git even
with ’em, and then go ahead on ’em&mdash;as fur ahead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>as Lake Superior is bigger than their inland
lakes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lakes!” sez Martin scornfully&mdash;“ponds, you
mean.”</p>

<p>But I went on in not mindin’ him.</p>

<p>“Or the St. Lawrence is bigger than the Rhine,
but it will take a long, long time. And then
in a lot of other things these countries are superior
to ourn. They train their children better in some
of these countries. Their children have as much
agin reverence and respect for parents and gardeens,
and them who are in authority, as American
children have. Why, a English or a German
mother would faint away with horrow to see a lot
of American children behave, and boss round their
folks, and act. And then look at&mdash;”</p>

<p>I wuz jest on the pint of bringin’ up a lot more
of things in which these countries excelled ourn,
when Martin looked at his watch, and sed that he
must be in a distant part of the city in ten minutes
by the clock; so he went out. I presoom he hated
to lose my eloquent and instructive remarks; but
he had to go.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">GERMANY AND BELGIUM.</p>

<p>Martin sed he shouldn’t think of travellin’ in
Germany, as he had made a very exhaustive study
of the country on a visit he’d paid it some years before.
I knew Alice had been there two years, a-stayin’
with a Miss Ponsione, a music-teacher, as nigh
as I could make out, a kind of foreign creeter, I
guess.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I gave more exhaustive attention to Germany
than to any other country in Europe, and I
would not wish to make a needless expenditure of
time there.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Martin, how long a time did you stay in
Germany?”</p>

<p>“Over a week,” sez he.</p>

<p>Wall, thinkses I, accordin’ to his idees that is
considerable of a time. Alice, of course, didn’t care
to stay there long, as she had stayed there all durin’
her vacations, and took excursions all over the
country with that Miss Ponsione and her folks;
there seemed to be a hull lot of ’em, all girls, as nigh
as I could make out.</p>

<p>And it wuz from her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>that I learnt that her Pa
had fell and sprained his ankle and hurt his head,
and wuz bed-sick all the time he wuz in Germany;
he wuzn’t able to lift his head from the piller, and
so I guess it wuz ruther exhaustin’
study he gin to it.
But I wanted to see the Rhine&mdash;I
wanted to see “Fair Bingen
on the Rhine,” I wanted to
like a dog, and I told Alice so.</p>

<p>But she said Bingen looked
jest about like any other city.
And come to think on’t, I
spoze it wuz the homesick
longin’ for his own country
that made the “Soldier of the
Legion” want to see it so bad,
and made its seenery seem
fairer and lovelier, and made its
moonlight fairer and brighter
than that which looked down
on that fur-off battle-field,
where his body lay, and his
homesick sperit a-wanderin’ off to “Fair Bingen on
the Rhine.”</p>

<p>I eppisoded this to Josiah, and he sez with a sad
look on his face&mdash;he wuz awful beat out, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>corns ached fearful&mdash;“Yes, that is it, I feel jest so;
I could talk jest as melogious and affectin’ this minute
about ‘Fair Jonesville on the Lyme.’”</p>

<p>Sez I, “You may feel jest as bad, Josiah, but you
can’t write sech poetry as that.”</p>

<p>“Whattle you bet?” sez he, a-settin’ the bottle of
liniment on the stand; he’d been tryin’ to irrigate
them corns of hisen and quell ’em down some.
“Whattle you bet I can’t?”</p>

<p>Sez I mildly, “That Soldier of the Legion wuz
dyin’ in Algiers.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I’m a-dyin’ in France; what’s the
difference?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “His talk about his distant home is enough
to make anybody weep.”</p>

<p>“Home!” sez he. “Can’t I talk about home?
Why,” sez he, “if I should swing right out into
poetry and describe my feelin’s, nobody would look at
that soldier’s verses agin, if I should let myself out and
tell the beauties of Jonesville, and what we’ve been
through sence we left its blessed presinks; why that
soldier didn’t begin to know what trouble wuz. He
wuz a single man,” sez he.</p>

<p>I looked coldly at him, and he hastened to add
with a deep groan, “Oh, what hain’t we been
through, in verse or out on’t&mdash;what hain’t we been
through! two old folks snaked through Europe by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>a Martin and Fashion; no attention paid to rumatiz,

kind of a rhymin’ axent, “wuz born in Jonesville&mdash;‘fair
Jonesville on the Lyme.’”</p>

<p>I wuz born myself pretty nigh the town of Lyme,
jest over the line, but I wouldn’t contend.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I could make up hull books of poetry
on our tower better than hisen, enough sight.”</p>

<p>“No you can’t, Josiah,” sez I; “jest think of
them beautiful messages he sent back to them distant
friends of hisen; it hain’t in you to write like
that.”</p>

<p>“Wall, it <i>is</i> in me, mom; and messages! Gracious
Peter! couldn’t I send messages back? Couldn’t I
send heart-breakin’ messages to the children, and
Ury, and Philury, and Deacon Henzy, and Uncle

<p>His axents on these last words wuz affectin’ in

<p>etc., etc., etc., all put down jest as if he wuz in a
dyin’ state; no regularity or symetry in the lines,
but powerful in feelin’s. There wuz more’n twenty-one
on ’em. I didn’t hear all on ’em&mdash;I wouldn’t,
and we had some words.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin wuz sot on not goin’ to Germany,
till Adrian sed he would love to see the Rhine.
That settled it&mdash;the Rhine wuz seen. That man
would go through fire and water if his little pardner
jest motioned him that way.</p>

<p>And that very fact, I felt, shed a perfect halo
round Martin Smith. It showed that deep down
in the nater of the man, all covered up by layers
of pride, worldiness, fashion, ambition, etc., there
wuz a fount of pure water a-springin’; but few indeed
could pierce down to it. Alice can, and
Adrian can, but nobody else, so fur as I know; but
that love permeates everything he sez and duz.</p>

<p>As wuz nateral on French sile, we got to talkin’
about poor young Prince Louis, the pride of the
third Napoleon&mdash;the very heart and soul of his
beautiful Ma. His sad fate seemed to impress
Adrian dretfully. He wuz dretful sorry for him,
and sed he wuz. Good little creeter! Any tale of
sadness and sorrer found a ready sympathy in his
tender, generous young breast. But Martin seemed
to draw a different moral from it, and sez he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>
when I wuz a-tellin’ how sorry I wuz for his poor
Ma, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“She ought to have looked ahead, she never
ought to have allowed him to go into such danger,
she ought to do as I do. I always surround my
boy with safeguards to keep him out of danger’s
way entirely, and therefore he is safe.”</p>

<p>But I sez, “Martin, in this world it is hard to
tell always where danger is, and who is really safe.”</p>

<p>“But I know,” sez he, “because I am right with
him. If he was a child of poor parentage, now,
one of the masses, why, then, I grant you I could
not surround him with such safeguards, but as it is
Adrian is perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>I felt that here it wuz a good place to gin a little
hint. Sez I, “Speakin’ of safeguards, Martin, have
you ever put them fenders on that line of cars of
yourn that they wanted you to?”</p>

<p>“No!” sez he, speakin’ up pretty sharp.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Don’t you feel that you ort to, for the
sake of children whose Mas and Pas love them jest
as well as you do Adrian?”</p>

<p>But he waived off that idee, sayin’, as usual, that
it wuzn’t expected that he wuz a-goin to spend his
life and fortune for the sake of the children of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>masses, who, two thirds on ’em, wuz better off
dead than alive.</p>

<p>I <i>hate</i> sech talk.</p>

<p>But he went on to prove by statisticks how they
grew up to be criminals, and paupers, and Coxeyites,
and the world wuz well rid on ’em if they died
in childhood.</p>

<p>I <i>hate</i> sech talk. He see my feelin’s, and he went
on jest as if nothin’ had been sed, and repeated that
Adrian wuz perfectly safe, and that his futer wuz
assured.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “I hope so, for he is a dretful
good little boy, and smart, and I hope he will make
a useful man.”</p>

<p>“There is no other child in the world like him,”
sez Martin, “and he will have a great and successful
future. I shall attend to that.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” I sez agin, “I hope so,” and I truly did.
But I felt dubersome about thinkin’ that Martin
had it all in his own hands&mdash;this is sech a queer
world, and so kinder surprisin’ and changeable.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin wuz as good as his word, we didn’t
stay long in Germany, but seein’ that Adrian wanted
to see the Rhine, we sot out for it. We went
through Valenciennes on the night train, which Josiah
sed wuz indeed a blessin’, and he sed that Martin,
in some things, did show great tax.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span></p>
<p>Sez I, “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’d been a-wantin’ to git some of that
lace of theirn for a nightcap, or sunthin’, if you
hadn’t been sound asleep and a-snorin’.”</p>

<p>I never snore, and he knows it. He is the one.
I may sometimes breathe a little hard, that’s all.
And I sez, willin’ to give him a woond for the onmerited
snore eppisode, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can git some in Brussels; their lace wears like
iron.”</p>

<p>He wuz earnest in a minute, deeply earnest.
Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you knew, Samantha, how becomin’ your
nightcaps are, and how perfectly sweet you look
with the plain muslin ruffles round your dear face,
you wouldn’t speak of lace.”</p>

<p>That “dear” touched my heart. He hadn’t used
the adjective in some time. But I wouldn’t promise
not to git any. I think he worried all the time
we wuz in Brussels, but he needn’t. I am a good
economizer, I didn’t lay out to git any&mdash;I had
above a yard of good Torchon to home. I didn’t
need any lace.</p>

<p>Godfrey D. Bouillon stood up in plain sight jest
as he has been a-standin’ for a number of years,
a-holdin’ up the banner of the Cross. Good, determined
creeter he wuz.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>
<p>Wall, we went to see public buildin’s and towers,
from them one to three or four hundred feet high
to more megum ones, and galleries of paintin’s, and
parks and statutes; and one little statute rigged up
as a kind of a fountain, I won’t say nothin’ about&mdash;the
least sed the soonest mended. But it wuz a shame
and a disgrace, and if I’d had my way the poor little
creeter would have had at least a shirt put onto
him, or I would know the reason why.</p>

<p>A perfect shame to behold!</p>

<p>In the Museum of Paintings Josiah got real
skairt. He wuz kinder prowlin’ round, and he happened
to see a door partly open, and it wuz nateral,
so he sez, to kinder look in. But he shrunk back
in extreme perterbation, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“By Jehoshaphat, what have I done?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “What is it, Josiah?”</p>

<p>Sez he, his face as red as anything, “A woman
jest dressin’ herself&mdash;she seems all broke up.”</p>

<div class="figright illowp46" id="i_537" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_537.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">A woman jest dressin’ herself&mdash;she
seems all broke up.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “you keep out of there; you stay
right by me.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I lay out to!” he snapped out.</p>

<p>Wall, I looked in myself. I had no curosity, but
I felt that I had better see if my pardner had done
any harm. And I see a young woman all kinder
crouched together a-holdin’ her clothes round her,
and I sez&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span></p>
<p>“Mom, you needn’t be afraid, my pardner
wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head.”</p>

<p>She didn’t move a mite, but jest held her clothes,
what she had on, round her, and looked at me
kinder skairt. And I spoke up some louder, thinkin’
mebby she wuz deef; sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“He is a deacon in the Jonesville
meetin’-house, mom, and
though fraxious a good deal of the
time, a likely man.”</p>

<p>But jest at this junkter Martin
come up behind me, and told me
that it wuz a picter. I wuz dumbfoundered,
but so it wuz. The artist,
Wiertz by name, made quite
a number considerable like it; dretful
curous and surprisin’, but it is
a sight to see ’em.</p>

<p>The meetin’-house of St. Gudale,
with its stained glass winders, wuz
extremely interestin’ to see; it is
most a thousand years old, but no one would mistrust
it. It looks fur better than our meetin’-house,
that hain’t over fourteen years old, if it is that. But,
then, it cost more.</p>

<p>Martin and Josiah and Al Faizi driv out to see
the battlefield of Waterloo, only about six milds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>away. They went in a English coach with a half a
dozen horses, and a bugle a-caracolin’ high and clear.
I never see Josiah in better sperits.</p>

<p>I would have gone, too, but Alice wuzn’t well, nor
Adrian nuther, and I stayed with ’em; and I wuz
glad of a chance to rest my lower legs.</p>

<p>I spoze they had a number of emotions as they
stood on that field where the Star of Austerlitz sot.
I did, where I wuz a-layin’ down or a-settin’ to home.
Truly to a feelin’ heart, who contemplates what
high ambitions tottled over that day, and what
powerful interests wuz involved, they may say truly
that they carry the battlefield of Waterloo in their
hearts.</p>

<p>I thought on’t a sight. I had read what Victor
Hugo said about that battle, and Alfred Tennyson
and others had said about the Duke of Wellington,
a-praisin’ him up, and I had numerous feelin’s and
emotions, very powerful ones, indeed, very; but I
took good care of the children all the same.</p>

<p>There wuz one place in Brussels that I wanted
to see as much as any other place I could look on
offen my tower, and that wuz where Charlotte
Brontë had spent those years, those quiet but dretful
tragic years of her life.</p>

<p>So one day, when we wuz on our way home from
some big palace or monument&mdash;Martin wanted to
show off before us&mdash;I persuaded him to go a little
out of our way to that quiet street, to the kinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
old-fashioned house where the Professor ust to teach
school, and some of his folks live now and keep a
small school. They let us in when they found out
that we wuz Americans; truly that name opens all
sorts of foreign doors.</p>

<p>It wuz a half holiday, and they let us walk
through the room where she ust to set and study,
and the old-fashioned garden where she ust to walk
and dream them strange dreams of hern, that afterwards
charmed the world.</p>

<p>Though the folks here didn’t seem to think of
her as I did&mdash;no, indeed! They seemed to kinder
blame her for reflectin’ on ’em in her books. Still
they must respect to a certain degree the memory of
one that leads so many from distant lands to their
out-of-the-way home, jest to stand on the floor she
trod on; jest to look on the walls that rared up
around that great soul.</p>

<p>What emotions Charlotte did have here! She
had more to bear than most folks knew of&mdash;yes,
indeed!</p>

<p>What wuz that hantin’ grief that rung her soul
so that year in Brussels, that drove her, a devout
Protestant, into a Catholic church, to pour out her
agony in confession? Longin’ to give vent to the
sorrer that without that relief wuz mebby a-urgin’
her to forgit it all in the long quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span></p>

<p>Why, a pint bottle full of sweet turned bitter,
must have vent gin to it or else bust.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! poor, little, lonesome creeter!
with her intense power of lovin’, and
her intenser tenderness of conscience.</p>

<p>Gray old city, never did one tread
your streets with more need of heart
pity than she who wuz swept along by
her emotions that day into an alien
temple, a strange altar, and a strange
worship, seekin’ for rest, for help to live,
which is so much harder than to die.</p>

<p>I know what the matter wuz&mdash;it
come to me straight, but I sha’n’t tell
it, it has got to be kep’.</p>

<p>Wall, I had a large white handkerchief
with me, I took it a purpose, for I
thought more’n as likely as not I should
be melted into tears a-meditatin’ on her life and all
she had done to delight the world, and how after
her life-long struggles and her brief wedded happiness
she passed away.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp43" id="i_540" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_540.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>I thought more’n likely
I should be melted into
tears.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But no, this last thought kinder boyed me up&mdash;I
wuz glad to know that she lay asleep by the lonely
moors of Haworth. Its long purple wastes hanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>by her shade forever, a sleep never to be distracted
agin by her brother Patrick’s actin’ and behavin’, or
her pa’s morbid idees and ways, or her own private
heartache.</p>

<p>Little, small-boneded, great-minded creeter! how
often I’ve pictered her lonesome life in that little
village, shet up in oncongenial surroundin’s, her
noble sperit beatin’ agin the bars of her environment;
a-settin’ on lonesome evenin’s in a bare,
silent room, a-pinin’ mebby for a word of sympathy,
and the clasp of a comprehendin’ hand, and the
great world a-praisin’ her fur off&mdash;<i>too fur</i>.</p>

<p>Or else a-walkin’ up and down in the twilight
with her sisters a-plannin’ them strange stories of
theirn.</p>

<p>And then I come back to the bare walls of the
school-room at Brussels, and I presoomed that on
these very bare walls we wuz a-lookin’ on Charlotte
had seen stand out vivid the strong, dark face of
Rochester, and the elfin figger of Jane, Shirley,
Caroline, Louis and Robert Moore, the Professor&mdash;yes,
indeed, she see <i>him</i>, I hain’t a doubt on’t&mdash;and
all these wonderful characters of hern, who seemed
more real friends and neighbors to me than them
who live under the chimblys I can see from my own
winders to home.</p>

<p>Good, little, bashful creeter! sech genius as you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>had the world will seek a good while for before it
finds agin.</p>

<p>While these thoughts wuz a-goin’ on under my
best bunnet, Martin looked round sort o’ indifferent,
and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who wuz she, anyway&mdash;some kind of a writer?”</p>

<p>And I sez, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Historical or poetical?” sez he.</p>

<p>And I sez, “Both.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t bring my emotions down in that place
to explain, and I told the truth, anyway. Historys
she wrote that always will be true as long as hearts
beat and suffer. Poetry wuz in ’em, whose great
rythm hants the hearts of ’em whose ears are
tuned to understand the strange melodies. For no
two people can ever find the same things in a book&mdash;what
inspires you, and thrills your heart almost
to bustin’, will slip over the head and heart of somebody
else, and make no impression.</p>

<p>Curous, hain’t it?</p>

<div class="figright illowp55" id="i_543" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_543.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A-leadin’ Adrian and a-plannin’ sunthin’ with

</div>

<p>Wall, we looked round for a long time&mdash;Josiah
not enjoyin’ himself a bit, so fur as I could see, but
a-leadin’ Adrian and a-plannin’ sunthin’ with him relatin’
to a whistle he could make out of a stick.</p>

<p>Alice’s soft eyes held sweetness and compassion,
but she owned that she’d never read the books.</p>

<p>Al Faizi, too, wuz a stranger to ’em. But he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>would have enjoyed ’em if he had&mdash;he’s made in jest
the right way.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin wuz in haste, and we left the sacred
spot, leavin’ a little gift, too, in the hands of the old
servant who showed us round.</p>

<p>Antwerp, Düsseldorf, Cologne,
how they kinder swim
along in my mind as I think
of ’em&mdash;picters, picters,
church towers, bells, gardens,
steeples, music, stained-glass
winders, quiet seenery,
grand, impressive ditto, big
carriages, dorgs harnessed up
as horses.</p>

<p>As we noticed the number
of these latter, my companion
begun to lay on plans
agin. Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take our brindle, and
she that wuz Submit Tewksbury’s
yeller dorg&mdash;and she’d
lend her in a minute&mdash;and
what a team I could rig up with a little of Ury’s
help. I could take you to meetin’ to Jonesville
as easy as nothin’, and how uneek we would look
drawed along by a brindle and yeller dorg-team.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>It will, perchance, inaugerate a new era in navigation
in Jonesville, and dorg-teams will be in voge.</p>

<p>“What a sensation we will create amongst the
Jonesvillians: you in your parasol and I in my
dressin’-gown, mebby. What a uneek spectacle!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, coldly, “when you ketch me a-ridin’
in that way, Josiah Allen, it will indeed create a
sensation, for I shall be no more. It will be when
my corse is senseless and cold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shaw! What comfort could I take then,
Samantha? It wouldn’t look very well for me to be
a-enjoyin’ myself a-swingin’ out in fashion then,
and I couldn’t wear the dressin’-gown or the tossels,
anyway. It beats all how you love to break up all
my plans for astonishin’ the Jonesvillians. You
know well enough that folks when they git back from
European towers always act different&mdash;more riz up
like, and reminescent, and astonishin’, and everything.
And you frown down all my plans, every
one on ’em”; and he sithed bitterly. But I wouldn’t
gin in to him, for I felt that Samantha and a dorg-team
wuz not synonomous terms; no, fur from it.</p>

<p>Wall, in Cologne I’d been glad to bought a hull
bottle of cologne, but Josiah said to his mind there
wuz nothin’ on earth so sweet as the smell of caraway.</p>

<p>I most always do up a little sprig on’t in my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
handkerchief when I go to meetin’, to kinder chirk
me up in my head some as the minister and my
mind are a-wanderin’ up from the 12thlies to the
“Finally, my dear hearers.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, attacktin’ the weakest jint in his
armor, “cologne is so stylish.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, and I couldn’t scold him for sayin’
it&mdash;sez he, “don’t you remember how the caraway
grew amongst the roses in the old front yard to
Mother Smith’s?” Sez he, “You had a sprig of
caraway in your hand the very minute I asked you
to be my bride&mdash;I had a little snip on’t in my
pocket when I led you to the altar, and a big vase
of the white blows kinder riz up above the June
roses like a halo, right there on the altar.”</p>

<p>He meant the cherry stand that we stood by, with
curly maple draws.</p>

<p>Sez he, “Oh, them beautiful, holy memories!
And then,” sez he, with a look of deep content, “to
think of the cookies you’ve garnished with it
durin’ the beautiful years of our union.” Sez he,
“Nothin’ like the scent of caraway to me.”</p>

<p>I wuz deeply moved by the sweet and tender
memories he invoked.</p>

<p>Oh, summer hours! oh, old front garden, lit by
the settin’ sun a-shinin’ through the maples! I see it
agin, I almost feel the shadders of the tall lilock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>bushes; I see the June roses a-shinin’ like rosy stars
above the deep lush grass, and the delicate white
tracery of the caraway a-hoverin’ over ’em like a
snowy mist.</p>

<p>Oh, summer garden! oh, summer hours of life!
oh, beauty and bloom, divine sadness and rapter,
and rich promise of the glowin’ futer a-layin’ fur
off in the distance, like the sun in the glowin’
west.</p>

<p>My Josiah had brung ’em all back to me. What
wuz cologne or bergamot in them rapt hours?</p>

<p>Men are deep.</p>

<p>The cathedral is a sight to see. It is called one
of the most beautiful cathedrals in Europe, and they
don’t lie about it when they say it is. It wuz begun
eight or nine hundred years ago, and two hundred
men wuz to work at it. I wonder if they are slack.
Anyway, I don’t have any idee when they lay out
to finish it. I guess they are to work by the day.
I know jest how they acted when they wuz to work
at Josiah’s horse-barn. I believe it is better to
let barns, or cathedrals, or anything else out by
the job.</p>

<p>Wall, if I should describe jest that one enormous
old meetin’-house, and what we see in it and about it,
it would take a book bigger than Foxe’s “Book of
Martyrs.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span></p>
<p>I won’t try, but it wuz a sight, a sight to see&mdash;carvin’s,
statutes, picters, towers, canopies, arches,
altars, relicks, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Among the most interestin’ of the relicks wuz the
skulls of the three Wise Men who came to worship
the infant Christ. Here their old skulls wuz shown&mdash;they
sed they wuz theirn. I d’no, nor Josiah
don’t, whether they wuz the Wise Men or not, and
of course it wuz eighteen hundred years too late to
ask ’em. No, wise as they wuz, their bones wuz
on a par with the bones of the ’leven thousand virgins
that we see there in another meetin’-house.</p>

<p>I d’no as they wuz virgins or not, or wuz massacreed,
as they sed. Martin sed it wuz a perfect
fraud. But I d’no either way. Anyway, there
the bones wuz, a real lot of ’em.</p>

<p>Wall, I guess the hull on us wuz glad to git
onto the little steamer that wuz to take us up
the beautiful Rhine. And we found that it wuz
indeed beautiful, though after bein’ on sech intimate
terms as I had been with the St. Lawrence and
the Hudson, I wuzn’t a-goin’ to say I had never
seen any river so grand&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p class="h2sub">SAMANTHA CLIMBS THE RIGHI.</p>

<p>Our noble St. Lawrence could have took the
Rhine in if she had been in need and adopted her,
and let her run along with her, a-murmurin’ and
a-babblin’ as children will, and nobody would have
been the wiser only the old Saint herself.</p>

<p>And the Hudson is jest as beautiful. No old
castles on the Rhine tower up so grand as Nater’s
old homesteads, the Palisades, where she has dwelt,
with Majesty, and Strength, and Sublimity, and
Beauty for hired help, for so many centuries, and is
a-livin’ there still in the same old place with the
same help. Them who have eyes to see, can see her
there right along day by day, and night by night, with
her help all round her. Sometimes the risin’ and
settin’ sun a-gildin’ their calm brows. And sometimes
the big, serene moon a-standin’ over ’em as if
lovin’ to linger with ’em. Their serene forwards
a-shinin’ with the love they have for him&mdash;or her
(I d’no whether to call the moon a him or a her.
It is so kinder changeable, my first thought wuz to
call it a him).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span></p>
<p>But to resoom. Yes, we found the Rhine beautiful.
It runs along in my memory now like a
beautiful paneramy right when I’m round the house
a-doin’ up my mornin’s work, or night-times when
I wake up ever or anon or oftener that fair picter
onfolds in front of me&mdash;the ripplin’ waters, the
shores sometimes smooth and grassy, with orchards
and vineyards; fields of grain, with wimmen a-workin’
in ’em, as well as men; high rocky shores, with
grim old castles perched up on the cliffs, tree-embowered;
anon a wayside shrine, with the image of
the Virgin a-lookin’ calmly on us tired voyagers, or
the face of our Lord hallowin’ the spot, or the baby
Christ in his Ma’s arms. It made the spots where
we see ’em more lifted up, and made me feel kinder
safer, though I knew it wuz only some wood and
paint and glass it wuz made of. I spoze it wuz the
memories and thoughts they invoked that seemed
to hover over us some like wings.</p>

<p>How it sweeps onward in my mind&mdash;high cliffs
three or four hundred feet high, with a picteresque
old castle perched on it; anon a bridge of boats
more’n a thousand feet long!</p>

<p>Then I see, a-lookin’ onto the paneramy, dog-teams,
peasants, soldiers, beautiful towns, queer little
villages, lovely villas, humble cottages, green
grass, wavin’ trees, blue murmurin’ river. Ah, how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>it floats along in front of my foretop! Coblentz&mdash;Thurnberg&mdash;then
the high cliff where the Siren ust
to set and sing. I wonder if she sets there now?
I mistrusted she’d kinder moved down into the vineyards.
She sings there a sight, lurin’ the wine lovers
right along to destruction.</p>

<p>Oberwesel, Castle Schonberg, and right acrost,
like a faithful old pardner who has kep’ company
for centuries, the towerin’ old walls of Gutenfels.</p>

<p>Right under my head-dress or nightcap the seen
moves along. Anon I see the splendid old castle
of Rheinstein way up above the river. Ehrenfel,
vineyards, vineyards, with Lurlei hid amongst ’em,
whether they believe it or not, and on the other, fur
up, the Mouse Tower, where selfishness got its pay
if it ever did.</p>

<p>Bingen we found, jest as Alice sed, a quiet little
town, its marvellous beauty born in the homesick
longin’ of the soldier who lay dyin’ in Algiers.</p>

<p>Johannesburg Castle would be dretful interestin’,
standin’ up as it duz three or four hundred feet high,
but the sights and sights of vineyards all round it
made me feel bad, dretful. But I’ve had my say
about that&mdash;sirens, etc., etc. What crazy acts
would the wine make these surroundin’ folks do!
That wuz a question I couldn’t answer, nor Josiah.
I wish they wouldn’t make so much; I wish they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>would stop the mouth of Lurlei with good water, or
cold tea, or sunthin’ or other&mdash;she’d act like another
creeter if they did.</p>

<p>But truly I couldn’t make ’em stop by eppisodin’
or allegorin’.</p>

<p>On, on we went by islands, fortifications, palaces,
villages.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to see Wiesbaden, I didn’t want to
see card-playin’ and gamblin’ goin’ on&mdash;no, indeed.</p>

<p>But I did want to stop at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
the birthplace of Goethe. And in thinkin’ on’t, I
mekanically repeated over the words I’d heard
Thomas J. rehearse a number of times&mdash;the homesick
words of Mignon&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Knowest thou the land where citron apples bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oranges like gold in leafy bloom?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She wanted to go back home, Mignon did, she
wanted to like a dog.</p>

<p>But Martin sed he didn’t know as anybody had
ever made a specialty of visitin’ the birthplace of
Goethe.</p>

<p>“And as for citron apples,” sez he, “your friend
evidently made a mistake in writing about them;
citrons grow on a vine; but,” sez he, “perhaps
Goethe was in the grocer line and was recommending
some new fruit.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span></p>
<p>And I let it go so. Truly the author of “Wilhelm
Meister” would have advised me to let it pass and
go by.</p>

<p>But when Martin learned that Rothschild wuz
born there, he sed that if he had had time he would
have loved to visit that hallowed spot.</p>

<p>Martin thought he would stop and take a kind of
a rest at Heidelberg, and my two legs and my pardner
wuz glad enough of the rest&mdash;yes, indeed!</p>

<p>Martin sed that any traveller of note made a
pint of visitin’ that spot, so it wuz on that account,
I spoze, that we stopped. He sed he
had seen a number of engravin’s of the place, and I
told him I had too.</p>

<p>We stayed all night to a comfortable tarvern,
and had a good supper and breakfust. Josiah admitted
we had, though he sed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Samantha, it don’t taste like your breakfusts;
oh, shall I ever partake of ’em agin in that blessed,
blessed home?”</p>

<p>He suffers dretfully, that man duz. But I told
him that we should soon be to home agin now, and
to bear up.</p>

<p>Wall, Heidelberg Castle is a sight, a sight to see.
All the picters we see of it in chromos and almanacks
and sech don’t give you any idee of how
grand, how vast it is.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span></p>
<p>Why, imagine a buildin’ all covered with
carvin’s, and towers, and pinnakles, and with
moats, and drawbridges, and dungeons, and courtyards,
and banquet-halls, and decorations of all
kinds, as big as from our house over to Deacon
Henzy’s, and back round by Solomon Bobbettses,
and acrost to Seth Shelmadine’s, and so
on around the two cross-roads and back to our
house.</p>

<p>Wall, reader, whether you believe it or not,
it covers as much ground as that, and you well
know how much ground that covers. Good
land! it is enough to make anybody’s
back ache to think of the days’ work it
took to build it. But, then, it wuzn’t all
done all in one job&mdash;it wuz begun a good
many hundred years ago. They didn’t shirk
their work, them old carpenters didn’t;
the makers of summer hotels could take
lessons of ’em in the matter of walls. It
would make one of them paper wall makers
swoon away to think of buildin’ a wall
twenty feet thick.</p>

<p>I wish I had one of them rooms to
take round with me summers on my towers.
It would be impossible for
the sound of snorers to penetrate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>into the apartment where one wuz vainly tryin’ to
woo the Goddess of Sleep. And midnight snickerers
would be futile to kill that Goddess with
their giggle-pinted arrers.</p>

<p>Of course, a big part of this immense buildin’
is in ruins.</p>

<p>A handsome old stone platform or piazza that
them old builders made half way up the castle walls
I did want to see. It had everything it needed in
the way of sculpters, vases, carved seats, etc. And
the view, oh! my poor head-dress, it almost rises
now as the paneramy sweeps through my foretop,
it gives sech elevatin’ thoughts and emotions.</p>

<p>How fur off, how fur off you could see&mdash;towns,
country, the blue Rhine, the mountains&mdash;oh, my
soul! wuz it not a fair seen, a fair seen!</p>

<p>But the barrel, or, ruther, hogsit, to hold wine in,
it jest madded me to see it. Would you believe it
that the very worst old drunkard you ever see or
hearn on would make a hogsit as big as the Jonesville
tarvern to hold his liquor in?</p>

<div class="figright illowp33" id="i_553" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_553.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A hogsit as big as the Jonesville
tarvern.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, it is, sir, full as big as Seth Widrigses
tarvern. I won’t compare it to a meetin’-house,
no, you can’t make me; the idee would be too
sacrilegious to me.</p>

<p>It wuz as big as Seth Widrigses tarvern, barrooms,
parlor, dinin’-room, bedrooms, ruff and all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
It holds two hundred and thirty-six thousand bottles
of wine.</p>

<p>The idee! it’s a burnin’ shame! How many
fights can be shet up in it at one time&mdash;broken
hearts, broken heads, murders, etc., etc., etc.!</p>

<p>I won’t talk about it another minute.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin sed that he spozed that it would
be expected of him to go and see the Righi.</p>

<p>(I spozed that he thought that in his high, prominent
position in society he ort to see some of
the most riz-up places, so he settled on that.)</p>

<p>Mont Blanc he sed he should not endeavor to
ascend, which wuz, indeed, a comfort to me; for
how I wuz a-goin’ to git up on that steep, icy
pinnakle with my heft and my rumatiz, to say
nothin’ of my umbrell and my pardner, wuz
more’n I knew. But if Martin had put his ultimatum
on that we must go, I knew that we should
have to make the venter.</p>

<p>But he gin up the idee. He is a-gittin’ kinder
short-winded himself, though he don’t own up to
it. So we clumb the Righi. We rid up on that.</p>

<p>Josiah wuz all carried away with the idee of goin’
up that mountain, because the engine that took us
up, instead of bein’ hitched on ahead to pull us up,
wuz tackled on behind a-pushin’ us.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span></p>
<p>Sez he, “Samantha, it will be sech a uneek ride.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>What will Uncle Sime Bentley say to it, and the
other Jonesvillians, when they hear on’t?”</p>

<p>There it wuz&mdash;fashion, fashion and display.
From different standpints, he and Martin wuz jest
alike.</p>

<p>But I knew that Josiah had some reason to be
sot up by it, for that way of goin’ up mountains
wuz a American idee at first.</p>

<p>Josiah took considerable comfort a-goin’ up
(owin’ to the feelin’s I have depictered). But
bein’ of sech a restless temperament, he soon announced
that he wuz a-goin’ to git out and walk up.
“For,” sez he, “I want to git there some time
to-day, and I hain’t a-goin’ to creep along like a
snail.”</p>

<p>But I seized him by his vest, and sez I&mdash;“Do
you set still; it will tucker you all out to walk up six
thousand feet!”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I want to git there some time
or ruther.”</p>

<p>We did indeed go slow, but sure; for in two
hours’ time we arrove on the summit, and wuz ensconsed
in a comfortable tarvern, from which, after Josiah
had satisfied his yearnin’s for food, and the rest
on us had refreshed ourselves with some refreshments,
we sallied forth to see the grandeur as well
as beauty of Nater; to behold what she can do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>when she humps herself, so to speak, and makes
glory.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_556" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_556.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>We did indeed go slow, but sure; for in two hours’ time we arrove on the summit.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, the view from the top of that mountain I
can’t never describe. I stood perfectly spellbounded,
and looked fur off down the mountain-side, and
see cities, and villages, and farm-housen, and sparklin’
streams, and, fur down below, beautiful Lucerne
and eight other lakes.</p>

<p>And on the off side the chain of snowy Alps
a-meltin’ upwards into the blue of the summer sky,
twelve thousand feet high, and on the nigh side
forests, hills, mountains.</p>

<p>Oh, wuz it not a fair seen&mdash;a fair seen!</p>

<p>I stood perfectly lost and by the side of myself.
The grandeur and beauty of the seen wuz so overwhelmin’
that, entirely onbeknown to myself, my
bunnet had fell backward on my neck, and I stood
bareheaded, jest as men do before a great heroine
or hero. (I spoze it is jest as proper to call the
Righi a female as a male; anyway, she stood up so
dretful calm and serene it didn’t seem as if a male
could hold that poster and calmness so early in the
mornin’. You know, males are dretful restless and
oneasy early in the mornin’. The work of the day
kinder takes the tuck out of ’em, and they grow
more sedater.)</p>

<p>But, anyway, I stood there bareheaded, jest as
anybody ort to before the great Presence. The on-matchable
grandeur of the seen&mdash;the sun a-beatin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
down onnoticed on my gray “crown of glory,” when
I hearn a voice clost beside me, and the words kinder
brung me back, for I had been quite a distance
away from the real world of trouble and tourists
and things.</p>

<p>The voice said&mdash;“For the land’s sake! I wouldn’t
run the risk you do of tanning myself all up, for
anything in the world.”</p>

<p>I wuz brung clear down, and I looked round, and
I see standin’ clost to me a female, jedgin’ from
her matronly form and her gray hair, that kinder
meandered down on the neck of her ulster behind,
of about my own age, or a little older, mebby. Yes,
she wuz probble a number of years older, and
though our hefts wuz jest about alike, she hadn’t
got nigh so noble a figger.</p>

<p>She had two veils over her face besides a lace one&mdash;two
braize veils, a green and a brown one, and
carried a big umbrell, histed up to its full height,
the umbrell a-lookin’ firm and decided, as if it calculated
to shet off all the grandeur the braize veils
didn’t make out to.</p>

<p>Sez she, as I slowly turned round and brung my
spectacles to bear on her with a gray flame of wonder
and surprise a-shinin’ through each one on ’em&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span></p>
<p>Sez she, “I wouldn’t tan my nose as you’re tanning
yours for worlds like this.”</p>

<p>I sez mekanically, “Why, why not tan your
nose?”</p>

<p>“Why, it would detract so from my looks; a
nose adds so much to the looks of a human face,”
sez she.</p>

<p>That sounded reasonable, and I sez, “Yes, that
is so; a nose is necessary, both for beauty and for
use; but,” sez I, “at our age a nose or two more or
less, or a little tan on some on ’em hain’t a-goin’
to either make or break us&mdash;they won’t draw much
attention,” sez I. “And even if they did, I expect
to enjoy the society of my nose for quite a number
of years yet, on towers and off on ’em, but this seen
of grandeur I’m a-biddin’ good-bye to,” sez I, sadly&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is hail, and farwell, to me&mdash;I never expect
to see it agin with these mortal eyes.” And I
looked off on the lovely seen agin with all the rapter
and sadness sech thoughts carry with ’em, when
agin my rapt emotions wuz brung downward by
the voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, I know I wouldn’t run the risk you do
of spoiling my complexion for thousands of worlds
like this.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>I felt that she needed roustin’ up and improvin’
upon, and I sez&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span></p>
<p>“Mom, I believe you’d enjoy Nater as much
agin, if not more, if you’d forgit your complexion.
Let your nose retire into the background, so to
speak, and open the winders of your soul to the
divine influences&mdash;look about and soar away, so to
speak. And how you can do that under three
veils and that umbrell is more’n I can tell.”</p>

<p>Sez she, confidentially, “I am dead tired of seeing
things, anyway&mdash;I love to rest my eyeballs.”</p>

<p>“Then,” sez I, pityin’ly, “what be you up here on
the Rigi for? What made you climb up so fur?”</p>

<p>“Well,” sez she, “I came with a party of Cook
tourists, and you know just what they are for boasting;
I’m not going to have them crow over me because
they have been where I haven’t. Three of
them are bed-sick at the hotel, but they can say with
truth that they have been here. Two of the girls
have to wear bandages over their eyes, and can’t see
a thing, but they both have emulative Mas, who
are bound that they shan’t be out-travelled by the
rest of the girls, and so they are leading them
round through Europe; blind as bats, but full of
the true Cook fervor of travel.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp63" id="i_561" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_561.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">They have emulative Mas, who are bound that they shan’t
be out-travelled.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” sez I, “how bad it is for ’em!”</p>

<p>“No; they enjoy it. The doctor says all they
need is quiet and rest to restore their eyesight, and
they will have it when this cruel war is over and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>they get home. One of them is my own girl,” sez
she, in a burst of confidence, “and I’m out here
unknown to the rest; so my girl has outdone them,
so to speak, for of course it is just the same as if
she stood here where her Ma stands, in this be-a-u-ti-ful
place, looking at this magnificent
scenery.”</p>

<p>And she turned her wropped-up
face towards the tarvern door,
and faced round towards Josiah.</p>

<p>But truly she wuzn’t to blame,
she couldn’t see through that
envelopin’ drapery. The tarvern
might have been a waterfall, and
my Josiah a Alp for all she
knew.</p>

<p>I felt quite curous, but consoled
myself a-thinkin’ they wuz
a-follerin’ their own goles, and
would all set on ’em when they
got home.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz that very afternoon that I heard my
first yodellin’&mdash;the melogious cry of the Alpine
shepherds to one another. Clear and sweet it rung
through the still air&mdash;Ye-o-lo-leo-leo-leo&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright illowp53" id="i_563" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_563.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Ye-o-lo-leo-leo-leo&mdash;the melogious
cry of the Alpine shepherds.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Melogious as any music you ever hearn, only sort
o’ bell-like, and pecular. And while you stand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>spellbound and wantin’ to hear it agin the answer
comes, sweet, fur away, clear&mdash;</p>

<p>Ye-a-oo-ye-ho-oo&mdash;</p>

<p>It wuz like nothin’ I ever hearn in my life, and
yet seemed sort o’ familar to me, after all, as all
true beauty in sight and sound duz seem to its devotees,
he or she.</p>

<p>Wall, I wuz so lost in my own feelin’s of delight,
and so carried away some distance by ’em, that I
clean forgot that I wuz still in the flesh and still had
a earthly pardner by the name of “Josiah.” But
I wuz too soon fetched back to a realizin’ sense on’t.</p>

<p>For even as the sweet echoes wuz a-floatin’ back
from peak to peak lingerin’ly, as if they wuz loth to
let go on ’em, a voice spoke beside me&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ll hear yodellin’ when we git home,
Samantha Allen. Hereafter I shall never say ‘co-boss,
co-boss’ to cows, or ‘co-day, co-day’ to sheep;
after this I shall always yodel to ’em. Why,” sez
he, “what a stir it will make in Jonesville! how the
inhabitants will gather round me as I stand on the
blackberry hill and yodel acrost to the creek paster!
Why,” sez he, all carried away with the subject, as
his nater is, “mebby I can learn Uncle Sime Bentley,
so he can yodel back to me; mebby,” sez
he, growin’ ambitious, “I shall yodel to Sister Bobbett
and she that wuz Submit Tewksbury.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span></p>
<p>Sez I coldly&mdash;“Do you confine your yodellin’ to
dumb brutes, Josiah, who hain’t got sensibilities nor
feelin’s to be woonded.”</p>

<p>“Mebby you hain’t willin’ I should yodel to Ury;
but I’ll let you know I shall anyway, mom!”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “he is used to your performances;
he won’t mind ’em so much.”</p>

<p>I knew it wuzn’t best to draw the string too tight;
I knew I couldn’t break up his yodellin’ out to the
barn, or round, when I wuzn’t in sight, and I felt
that I would be glad to confine it to dumb brutes,
and Ury, and sech.</p>

<p>Wall, anon, after passin’ through lovely seens&mdash;lovely
ones, we found ourselves on beautiful Lake
Lucerne, the most beautiful lake in Switzerland, or
the hull world, for all I know&mdash;beautiful, beautiful
for situation it is. You could spend weeks a-admirin’
the lovely views, and then begin agin and keep
it up for years.</p>

<p>And before long we found ourselves, much to my
pardner’s relief, in a good tarvern with a long Swiss
name, that I always forgit, and called it to myself
“The Swizzler,” which wuz jest as good so fur as
I wuz concerned.</p>

<p>We didn’t stay here long, owin’ to Martin’s pecular
views. But we hearn the organ in the old
cathedral, and I wuz carried fur away from myself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</span>into the land of happiness, love, and peace, into the
realm&mdash;where is it?&mdash;that lays so nigh to us, that a
burst of glorious music will sweep us right into its
gates, but so fur off that we hain’t never ketched a
glimpse of its glorified mountains with
our nateral eyes.</p>

<p>Al Faizi wuz carried into that same
realm, too, I could see by his mean,
and the rest on ’em wuz carried off
wherever their nateral bent lay&mdash;Alice
into the land of Love and Hope,
Martin into the Stock Exchange
mebby, where the roar of its bulls
and bears drownded out the sound of
the organ’s grand, melancholy voice.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp45" id="i_566" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_566.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Listening to the organ’s grand,
melancholy voice.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And Josiah, wall, mebby he wuz
a-settin’ agin to a full dinner table in
Jonesville, with Deacon Sypher and
Drusilly and some of the other bretheren
and sistern a-hangin’ breathless
onto his adventers.</p>

<p>I d’no, I’ve only guessed at their emotions, but
mine wuz a sight to see as the liquid waves of melody
swep’ round me, and swep’ me along with it.</p>

<p>And then we see the Lion of Lucerne, a-layin’
there carved out of solid rock, in memory of the
Swiss Guard, who fell defendin’ the Tuilleries in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span>1792. It wuz carved by Thorwaldsen, the great
Danish sculptor, and is a noble and impressive sight.
There it lay in a beautiful grotto, with water tricklin’
all round it, some as if the hull country wuz
a-sheddin’ tears over them poor young men that
perished in their prime. It lay stretched out, its
hull length of twenty-eight feet, a-holdin’ in its
paws the shield of France and some flower de luce&mdash;France
is jest sot on them poseys, and I always
liked them myself; I’ve got a big root of ’em under
my bedroom winder at home in Jonesville.</p>

<p>I thought considerable in our short sojourn at
Lucerne about William Tell, whose exploits with
Gessler, apples, etc., took place in that vicinity
(though I’ve hearn tell that Tell hain’t the creeter
they tell on).</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>I thought considerable about William Tell and his exploits with

</div>

<p>But I always loved to read about him, and I
always did kinder love to believe in things that ort
to be true, if they hain’t&mdash;about liberty, freedom, and
sech. Anyhow, he has got a high chapel built to
him&mdash;mebby like some other popular idees, that
haint got no greater foundation in solid truth.</p>

<p>Though, agin, what is truth?</p>

<p>Hard question.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</span></p>
<p>Wall, our way on to Lake Geneva wuz like a dream
of glory and grandeur, full of mountain peaks,
green and snow-clad, and flashin’ waterfalls, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</span>little side dreams of sweet green valleys&mdash;“sweet
fields arrayed in livin’ green”&mdash;quaint villages, cosey
little housen, swift dashin’ waterways, and gently
flowin’ rivers.</p>

<p>Interlaken, Freiburg, Lausanne, how they look
out of the paneramy at me when I shet my
eyes in the Jonesville meetin’-house or anywhere,
and onto the blue lake that Byron writ so much
about.</p>

<p>Alice had beset her Pa to take her to Castle
Chillon. And I had strange feelin’s, I can tell you,
as I walked down the road with Josiah Allen by
my side&mdash;from Jonesville meetin’-house to the
Castle of Chillon&mdash;what a leap! Could Fancy cut
up any stranger? I spozed we should have to take
a boat to reach it, and so they did in old times, but
now the water has filled in so, that, like the Israelites,
we passed over dry shod.</p>

<p>The castle is over a thousand years old. Some say
the Lake Dwellers built it, and in talkin’ about
them queer creeters, who dwelt a thousand years
ago in housen built up on posts stuck in the water,
I had another trouble with my too ardent and susceptible
pardner. Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Samantha, what a beautiful way of livin’ that
would be&mdash;how cool and pleasant in summer
weather, and so handy; no luggin’ in water to fill
the tank, no pumpin’, jest lean right out of the buttery
winder and draw in a pailful, and then how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span>
easy to lower the milk in the water to cool. Why,
we could have the milk-room built jest below the
surface, and set the milk pans right into the lake, as
it were. What butter we could make, how it would
be sought for! And then the idee of settin’ in your
own back door and fishin’ for pike and sturgeons,
draw ’em right up and land ’em on the kitchen
table, not a foot off from the briler. How convenient!
And bathin’ now, you’re always a-tewin’
at me about it&mdash;washin’ my feet, it’s always a job&mdash;but
now jest cut a little hole in the bedroom floor,
and with a towel there you are. I’ll commence a
house out on our pond the minute I git home for
a summer retreat, no mowin’ door-yards, no fences
to keep up, no gates to be onhingin’; why, I’d renew
my age there, Samantha. And then think of
the profit in the extra butter, etc.”</p>

<p>“How would it be about milkin’ the cows?” sez
I. I see he hadn’t thought of that or anythin’ else
practical, but he’d been jest carried away by the
novel and the new.</p>

<p>But he wouldn’t give in, men have such doggy
obstinacy. Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, learn ’em to swim; begin when they’re
yearlin’s, learn ’em to strike right out and swim up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</span>to the milk-house, hitch ’em to the post, and jest
set in the back door and milk ’em.”</p>

<p>“Under water?” sez I; “milk under water?”</p>

<p>I see he wuz gittin’ sick of the idee&mdash;sick as a
dog, but he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, milk ’em under the water in rubber bags,
jest as Ezekiel did, and Malachi, and all the rest on
’em.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “you’ll keep bachelder’s hall then,
and cook your own vittles and make your own
butter for all of me. I hain’t a-goin’ into any sech
enterprise.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “that don’t surprise me at all; I
never yet got up a uneek idee but what you backened
it all you could.”</p>

<p>Wall, we hung round here for some time, and I
meditated on how the prisoners must have felt,
condemned to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fetters and the damp vault’s dayless gloom.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And as I see how they had wore the very stuns
away, a-pacin’ back and forth in their narrer bounds
like caged lions, I felt like sayin’ with Byron:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“May none these marks efface,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For they appeal from tyranny to God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it wuz with quite saddened emotions that
we wended our way back to the tarvern Byron.</p>

<p>I see Al Faizi wuz dretful mournful-lookin’. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</span>always affected that good creeter to see how Truth
and Liberty and Jestice have always been trompled
on by Error and Ignorance all through the ages
and in all countries, and always would, so fur as I
could tell.</p>

<p>Geneva! Chamouni, how they glide past the
roused eye of my mind, that don’t need spectacles&mdash;no,
indeed! For never on earth, it seems to me,
was there sech grandeur of seenery as wuz here in
Chamouni. And the hull world seemed to have
found it out, for folks from all the countries of the
earth seemed to be represented here.</p>

<p>Here we wuz set down like little grains of sand
in a high pine forest, and that don’t carry out my
idee at all, for what is a pine-tree compared to
Mont Blanc&mdash;grand old giant standin’ up there
lookin’ down on the hull world, and seemin’ to be
kinder guardin’ it. I believe that even Martin’s
pride wuz kinder crumpled down a-beholdin’ that
wonder and glory.</p>

<p>On, on we went by wild and magnificent seenery,
by sweet sheltered spots, castles, farm-housen,
bridges, waterfalls, valleys, towerin’ hills, lofty
mountains, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Martigny&mdash;the wonderful Rhone valley, the
magnificence of the Simplon Road, straight up the
mountain-side, under waterfalls, over wild waters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</span>along abysses, through tunnels seemin’ly milds long,
openin’ out into new seens of beauty&mdash;oh, what a
time, what a time!</p>

<p>How many bridges did we cross? Josiah said,
groanin’, “Over ten thousand.” But I believe there
wuz only six hundred odd; but what would Miss
Gowdey and Sister Bobbett think of that, who
have always looked with some or at the thought of
goin’ to North Loontown, because they had to pass
over three bridges to git there, and go up a considerable
steep hill? What would these sistern do
under the circumstances that I wuz placed in? So
my almost crazed but riz-up brain would wildly
question me anon or oftener.</p>

<p class="h2sub">MILAN, GENOA, VENICE.</p>

<p>Wall, at last, under the fosterin’ care of Martin,
we wuz conveyed along into Italy and put up to a
place called Milan. But one memory of our way
thither stands out as plain in my mind as our
centre-table duz in my parlor; it is of beautiful
Lake Maggiore. A more beautiful piece of water
I don’t believe moistens this old earth. Them
sweet blue waters, with lovely Isola Bella terraced
into hite after hite of verdure and beauty, and
other islands a-standin’ out like clear blue stars in
a clear blue sky, and the Italians in their picteresque
dress, priests, peasants, etc., etc., wuz a seen
of enchantment, and even Martin looked kindly on
it, and admitted that it looked well. “But,” sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is it compared to our own Thousand
Islands? Why, nothing at all. Our own St.
Lawrence would take in the whole of Lake Maggiore
at one mouthful, and not know the difference.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Martin, don’t run down the beauty of another
country a-praisin’ up your own.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</span></p>
<p>“Well,” sez he, “do you find such perfection
here as in our own country?”</p>

<p>Sez I reminescently, “I find better telegraph
poles.” Sez I, “Think of the clear granite shafts,
good enough for monuments, and then think of
the humbly, crooked wooden poles that disfigger
our American landscape.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sez he, “you don’t often find them
here.”</p>

<p>Josiah sed if I wuz so bent on havin’ stun
telegraph poles, he and Ury could build up one
out of loose stuns in front of the house. Sez he,
“We might make it sort of a monument shape, and
Ury might kinder block out my figger on top.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “I guess it would be a work of art if Ury
did it.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “I might have a tin-type or
sunthin’ fixed on, or a lock of my hair. It would
be real uneek, and my fellow-townsmen would
think the world on’t.”</p>

<p>Mebby he’ll forgit the idee, and mebby I’ll see
trouble out on’t yet.</p>

<p>Wall, in Milan our first move wuz, of course, to
see the cathedral. I’d seen so many picters on’t
that it looked as familar as Betsey Bobbettses
liniment, only fur grander and more impressive
lookin’.</p>

<p>Yes, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</span> lookin’ at that wonderful buildin’ on
the outside and inside, I felt as if I wuz a heathen
creeter who had never seen a cathedral or a meetin’-house
in my life. Why, to make it clear to
everybody jest how grand and extensive it is, I will
say that if the pine woods on the hill back of Deacon
Henzy’s wuz all turned into pinnakles and
monuments and arches, and every pine needle on
’em wuz ornaments of delicate tracery and carvin’
and beautiful design, it could not be more impressive,
and to anybody who has seen them woods
that is sufficient. It is a dream to remember in
still nights when you lay on your piller and can’t
sleep. I think on’t time and time agin. Why, it
is so big that you could carry on a Stock Exchange
meetin’ at one end and a funeral at the other, and
not interfere with each other in the least; you
couldn’t hear the bulls and bears yellin’ or the
mourners a-weepin’ and wailin’, not at all.</p>

<p>And you climb up five hundred steps to the top,
and look down on all the beauty and glory of the
world&mdash;it is a sight, a sight.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin sed that he must make all haste
possible a-travellin’ through Italy, as business wuz
a-callin’ him home, but he must go to Genoa, the
birthplace of Columbus. Sez he, “Of course, considering
what he discovered and where he was of
late celebrated, that is by far the most important
place in Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span></p>

<p>Wall, I wuz glad enough to visit the birthplace
of that good, misused creeter. So we anon found
ourselves in Genoa, the Superb, as some call it,
and in good rooms in a big, comfortable tarvern.</p>

<p>The first thing we went to visit wuz the statute
of Columbus. It towers up, a poem in white marble;
and in a settin’ poster, on the four sides on’t,
are Religion, Gography, Strength, and Wisdom,
and all round ’em and between ’em are carved the
leadin’ events of Columbuses life. Every one of
them symbols carved out there&mdash;Religion, Strength,
etc.&mdash;Christopher had, and the world realizes it at
last.</p>

<p>I should think the world would have been
ashamed of itself after picterin’ out his grand doin’s,
his discoveries in the New World, to have sculped
him out in chains; it wuz a burnin’ shame, but his
memory is a-walkin’ down through the ages now
free and soarin’, no chains on it&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>But, poor creeter! how he would have enjoyed
bein’ made sunthin’ on, and used well while he wuz
here in the body! How he would have enjoyed
havin’ enough to eat, and hull clothes!</p>

<p>But sech is life.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin renewed his strength a-lookin’ on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</span>Columbuses statute and a-realizin’ what it wuz he
discovered and how his discovery is a-branchin’ out
and spreadin’ itself. He felt well.</p>

<p>Right acrost from the statute stands a big house,
which has writ on it, “Christopher Columbus Discovered
America.” Martin didn’t need to be told
on’t&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>As nigh as we could make out, Columbus wuz
born in that house. They showed us the very room
where he wuz born; but my lofty emotions in
viewin’ the spot wuz quelled down with the thought
that he wuz born in seven or eight other places.
Poor creeter! what a time he did have from first to
last!</p>

<p>In the Municipal Palace, among other curous
and valuable relicks, we see lots of relicks of Columbus&mdash;amongst
’em some autograph letters that he
had his own hand on.</p>

<p>Josiah sez, “He’s some like you, Samantha&mdash;ducks’
tracks is plain readin’ compared to ’em.”</p>

<p>I looked coldly at him, but did not dane to argy.</p>

<p>In a glass case, amongst lots of other things, we
see the violin of Paganini, the greatest violinist that
ever lived.</p>

<p>He, too, wuz a discoverer; divine realms of melody
wuz brung to view by his heavenly vision. He
wafted his hearers into that realm on the flood of
melody. I took sights of comfort a-lookin’ at that
old fiddle.</p>

<p>When my thoughts git started back to Italy, as
thoughts will, no matter where your body is&mdash;a-settin’
in the meetin’-house or out to the barn or anywhere&mdash;they
always linger sort o’ lovin’ly on Venice&mdash;Venice
that stands out in my mind
all by itself amongst cities, jest as
prominent as Thomas J. duz amongst
boys.</p>

<p>My Josiah wuz dumbfoundered when
we emerged from the depot to think
that he had got to go to our tarvern in
a boat; but so it wuz.</p>

<p>Then he demurred agin about the
convenience we wuz a-goin’ in.</p>

<p>He sez, “Dum it all, I hain’t a-goin’
to be drawed by a hearse whilst I am
alive!”</p>

<p>But I soothed him down by pintin’
out that the boats wuz all painted black.</p>

<p>But wuzn’t it a curous sensation to drive along
on streets of water, instead of good, honest dirt.
Bein’ kinder skairy of water, I whispered to Josiah&mdash;</p>

<p>“As bad as our roads in Jonesville be durin’ the
worst of Spring mud, I’d ruther navigate ’em with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</span>our wheels up to the hubs in mud than to ride down
these water streets.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “Samantha, we didn’t realize our priveliges
then, we made light on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “you used language on them roads
that you wouldn’t use now if you wuz set back on
em.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t talk any worse than the rest of the
Jonesvillians!” he snapped out. “And how these
streets smell&mdash;dead cats and pollywogs!” sez he,
turnin’ up his nose real high.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “less count over our blessin’s.
We can hold our noses while we are a-countin’,”
sez I. “Look at them towerin’ marble palaces;
see the carvin’ on them tall pinnakles and the arched
winders and the fretted ruffs,” sez I.</p>

<p>“The ruffs don’t fret no worse than my mind
duz!” sez he. “Oh,” he whispered with a low
groan, “shall we ever see the cliffs of Jonesville
once more!”</p>

<p>“Don’t give up, Josiah,” sez I, “here right in the
dream of the world, Venice, the beautiful.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “I hearn there wuz a sayin’, ‘See
Venice and die,’ and I can tell ’em that if this smell
keeps on, and if the dum muskeeters keeps on
a-bitin’, there’s one man who will foller their advice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Sez I, “They hain’t muskeeters, they’re nats,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</span>and it wuz Naples that wuz said on; and,” sez I,
wantin’ to roust him up, “they say Venice is perfectly
beautiful by moonlight.”</p>

<p>That kinder nerved him up, bad as he felt&mdash;he
seemed to look forrered to it, and after a good meal
and a good rest, when we did set off by moonlight,
hirin’ a gondola jest as we would a express wagon
to home, he admitted the beauty of the seen.</p>

<p>And it wuz like a journey through fairyland.
The long, glassy streets, all lit up by lights from
the tall, white palaces on each side on us, and by the
lanterns of the passin’ gondoliers; the soft, sweet
voices of the gondoliers as they called out to each
other in their melogious Southern tongue; the
glidin’ boats movin’ past us like shadder craft, with
the handsome, graceful forms of the gondoliers
a-drivin’ ’em, and anon or oftener the sweet strains
of a guitar, and some divine voice in song; and
the admirin’ surprise when you’d turn a corner and
look down another street of beauty, differin’ in form
of glory.</p>

<p>Oh, it wuz a seen to be remembered as long as
Memory sets up on her high-chair under my foretop!
And what hantin’ thoughts kep’ company with
me and filled the gondola to overflowin’! I seemed
to see Titian with his artist’s eyes and inspired pencil&mdash;the
old Doges with their embroidered and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</span>jewelled robes&mdash;sad-eyed Beatrice Cenci, Antonio,
Shylock, Wise-eyed Portia&mdash;I seemed to hear her
sayin’,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The quality of mercy is not strained,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The gondola wuz crowded by the fantom crowds
that set round me onheeded by my Josiah, jest as
sperit crowds may be cramped all round onbeknown
to us.</p>

<p>Wall, I expected that about the most interestin’
thing in Venice to me would be the Bridge of Sighs,
that stands, as Byron so eloquently observes, with a
palace on the nigh side, and a prison on the off side
(I may not have got the exact words, but it is the
same meanin’). And I had more emotions there
than I could count, as I looked at it.</p>

<p>Al Faizi wuz dretful interested in the old prison
and dungeons and in the relicks of the infamous
Council of Ten.</p>

<p>He writ pages in that book of hisen, and didn’t
come no more nigh depicterin’ all their atrocities
and abominations than one drop of water would to
exhaustin’ the ocean.</p>

<p>In the palaces we see the height of luxury and
richness of beauty. In the prisons and dungeons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</span>we can see the black depths of terror and cruelty
of the time when the Council of Ten ruled Venice.</p>

<p>The Doge’s palace is a dream of magnificence.
You look up the Giant’s Staircase, way up&mdash;up to
the great statutes of Mars and Neptune, where
them mean creeters wuz crowned&mdash;the Doges, I
mean. And then you can’t help meditatin’ that
whilst they clumb to the very top of magnificence,
they didn’t do well, they didn’t die peaceable in their
beds, none on ’em.</p>

<p>No, they wuz pizened, or had their heads cut off,
or sunthin’ or other, that interfered with their comfort.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want Josiah to be a Doge&mdash;not if he
could be jest as well as not. No, Dogein’ seemed to
be resky business in them days, and I presoom that
it would be now.</p>

<p>And then they wuz so awful mean some on ’em&mdash;jest
read what they done, it’s enough to skair you to
death almost. I had dretful emotions as I looked
at that long table where the Ten ust to set in silence,
and condemn men and wimmen to death.</p>

<p>They ort to be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>And then the Lion’s Mouth, where the papers
accusin’ folks wuz dropped by the people. The
paper dropped down into a chest so’s the wicked old
Ten could git holt of ’em.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</span></p>
<p>Miserable creeters! I’d love to gin ’em a piece of
my mind.</p>

<p>But Josiah wuz all took up with the idee; sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>“How convenient, how charmin’ it would be to
have a complainin’ box rigged up in the barn over
the manger or by the side of the haymow, so when
I wanted to complain of Ury I wouldn’t have to jaw
him and have him sass back! How much easier it
would be than jawin’! He’d like it better, too. And
you can have one, Samantha, to complain of Philury;
you could jest drop ’em in, and then you wouldn’t
have to tell ’em over to me when she wuz wasteful
or slack, or acted. Jest put ’em down on paper,
drop ’em into the box, and nobody but Philury
would be the wiser.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Do you spoze I’m a-goin’ to be feelin’
round writin’ complaints while a batch of cookies
are bein’ spilte, or a lot of good vittles throwed to
the hens? No, indeed! My tongue is good yet,
and active.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, it is!” sez he with a deep groan (I
d’no what he meant by it).</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “it would be good for it to rest a
spell, and it would be a good thing for me, anyway,
specially nights when I wuz sleepy,” and agin he
sighed (he acted like a fool).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</span></p>
<p>“And if you say so,” sez he, “we could have one
rigged up together for both on us&mdash;we ort to be
able to complain of our hired man and woman in
one complainin’ box. We might have it over our
back door, or on the smoke-house.”</p>

<p>But I waived off his idee, and mebby he gin it up,
and mebby, agin, he’ll try to rig up some contrivance
that won’t do no good, and take time and money.</p>

<p>Another one of the queer things them old Doges
ust to do wuz to marry the Adriatic to the city at
a certain time every year.</p>

<p>What did they want to marry water for?</p>

<p>But Josiah wuz all worked up with the idee, when
he hearn us a-talkin’ about it, and about the magnificent
ceremonies they went through with at the
weddin’.</p>

<p>Sez he, “How uneek it would be for me to
marry the creek to Jonesville and perform the ceremony
out to our mill-dam! It would be beautiful,
and it would be as cheap as dirt, too; Ury could
fix up a raft, and I could take one of the curtain
rings out of the spare bedroom to wed it with.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to be weddin’ the creek
for?” sez I coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, for fashion,” sez he&mdash;“style. Old-fashioned
things are so stylish now,” sez he. “You know
how them old, long, black clocks, humbly things in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</span>the first on’t as they could be&mdash;you know how they’re
set up in the boodores of luxury now, a-lookin’
like a coffin on end. And spinnin’-wheels and sech
that our grandmas ust to hustle out of the room, if
company come, now they’re sot up on velvet carpets,
and made sights on. And this manoover
would be dretful stylish. Oh, how the Jonesville
bridge would be crowded! how the Jonesvillians
would look on in admiration to see the sight!</p>

<p>“Of course I should wear my dressin’-gown. The
public has never had a chance to see it on me yet,
you have always been so sot on keepin’ me to home
in it. This would be a very agreeable treat to have
on Fourth of Julys, or any national holiday, and I
could carry it out perfectly and dog cheap, with a
little of Ury’s help.”</p>

<p>But I sot my foot right down on the idee to
once. Sez I, “It looks silly as anything in them
wicked old Doges, and you hain’t a-goin’ to import
any of their tricks into Jonesville. Next thing I’d
know you’d have a inquisition a-goin’ on, and a secret
tribunal of Ten.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it first-rate,” sez he, “if I could be the
10. I’d like to shake some of the sins and foolishness
out of Brother Gowdey and Deacon Henzy,”
sez he, “and bring ’em into my way of thinkin’.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</span></p>
<p>“There it is!” sez I. “Intolerance, bigotry, persecution,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</span>how fresh they be to-day in the human
heart! Jest as ready to spring up and act in 1895
as a thousand years ago.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I hain’t said I wuz a-goin’ to start it up
agin,” sez he, kinder cross like; “I only spoke on’t.”</p>

<p>I expected trials when I sot out to take my pardner
through Europe, and I wuzn’t dissapinted in it.
But if it hadn’t been for his ambition for display,
and his bein’ carried away by novelties, and his appetite,
he would have acted real well. But, anyway,
act or not, he’s the one man in the world for me,
and visey versey.</p>

<p>But, as I wuz a-sayin’, the palaces of them old
Doges rousted lots of emotions in my brain, and
the fantoms of their victims seemed to hover round
them old palaces as thick as the pigeons that come
with a rush of wing down into the great square of
St. Mark at jest two o’clock, where they are fed by
order of the government.</p>

<p>The grand old Church of St. Mark interested me
dretfully. It is built in the form of a Greek
cross, with a big dome in the centre, and full, full
to overflowin’ with glory of mosaic, precious stuns,
picters, monuments, altars, pillars, colenades, gold,
silver, and splendor of all sorts.</p>

<p>Josiah sez to me, “Our Jonesville meetin’-house
wouldn’t show off much compared to this.”</p>

<p>But I wuz some consoled in this by thinkin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</span> that
if our meetin’-house wuzn’t so gorgeous, there wuz
jest as big a lack of beggars and poor people of all
kinds a-hoverin’ on the outside on’t, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“If they should sell off some of their costly
things and try to improve the condition of these
poor beggars, they would raise themselves as
much as twenty-five cents in my estimation, and
I d’no but more.”</p>

<p>And Josiah sez, “It is hard to make a rotten
string stand up straight&mdash;it is hard to brace up
laziness, and dissipation, and improvidence, and
make anything on’t.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t dispute him, nor didn’t try to. But
I did love to prowl round in those old meetin’-housen
and see the wealth of interestin’ things in
’em.</p>

<p>In the Church of Santa Maria d’Frari, the beautiful
monument to Titian took my admirin’ interest.
It has angels, lions, all sorts of sculptered figgers
in elegant carvin’, and beautiful bas-reliefs of
his greatest works&mdash;“The Assumption,” “Martyrdom
of St. Lawrence,” and “Peter Martyr.”</p>

<p>Then the monument to Canova is a sight to see
in its beauty. Wall, he ort to had it; he did
enough work to make the world more beautiful.</p>

<p>In the Academy of Fine Arts we see sech sights
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span>of beautiful picters that my brain almost reels now,
a-tryin’ to recall ’em. But Titian’s “Assumption of
the Virgin” is one that you can’t forgit, no matter
how clost other idees press around it and squooze
aginst it.</p>

<p>Great picters by Paul Veronese, Tintoretto, and
other great masters&mdash;the walls are jest seens of
beauty.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want it told on&mdash;it ort to be kep’, but
Josiah told me right there in that sacred spot, that
he wuz sick of Madonnas&mdash;sick as a snipe.</p>

<p>But I told him that I wouldn’t own up to it, if I
wuz.</p>

<p>And he said he didn’t care who hearn him.</p>

<p>I wuz kinder sick on ’em myself, but didn’t want
to own up to it right there in a meetin’-house.
But, truly, anybody will see enough Holy Families,
Virgins, Madonnas, etc., to last ’em a long life, unless
they’re extravagantly fond of ’em. And every
artist seems to have painted his own idees of the
Holy Mother&mdash;mebby from his own sweetheart;
anyway, no two of ’em are alike. Most of ’em are
real fat and healthy lookin’. I never spozed she
enjoyed sech good health as they depicter; I
thought she wuz more kinder spindlin’ lookin’.
And then I imagined there wuz a ineffible look
to the face of the Mother of our Lord, sech, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span>it seems to me, they hain’t none of ’em ketched.
The Mother of our Lord! What a face she ort
to have to fit my idees of her! It’s resky work,
paintin’ divine things. I wouldn’t want to undertake
it, or have Josiah. Now I see the picter of
the Deity once painted with a hat on.</p>

<p>I didn’t love to see it.</p>

<p>Why, even to Moses the Great Presence wuz
surrounded by a flame of fire; and St. Paul fell
to the ground, struck by the blindin’ glory on’t,
and he wuz never able to put in mortal words
the sights he see&mdash;“Whether in the body or out
of the body, God knoweth.”</p>

<p>He wuz reverent. And it don’t seem quite the
thing to try to paint ineffible glories with chrome
yeller and madder. Howsumever, I spoze they
meant well.</p>

<p>And, indeed, some of the picters we see as we
journeyed through the Italian cities are all placed
in rows around the inside of my brain, and can’t
never be moved from there&mdash;no, the strings must
break down first that they hang up on.</p>

<p>In Florence the Beautiful, oh, the acres and
acres and acres of beauty that I walked through,
full to overflowin’ with beauty and glorious conceptions
and the white splendor of marble poems!
The works of Michael Angelo I hain’t a-goin’ to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</span>forgit them&mdash;no, indeed! nor Lorenzo Ghiberti,
nor the picters by Titian, Raphael, Rembrandt,
Tintoretto, Veronese, Van Dyke, Rubens, etc., etc.,
etc., and so forth, and so forth, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>I walked through the long picter galleries with
my brain and heart all rousted up, and enjoyin’
themselves the best that ever wuz, and my legs all
wore out and achin’ bad. And Josiah groanin’
audibly by my side. And Martin patronizin’ the
marvels of ancient and modern art, and havin’ a
good time. Al Faizi with his hat off, reverent and
devout in the presence of so much divine beauty.
And Alice, I spoze, thinkin’ of the past and the
futer, and Adrian eatin’ candy, etc.</p>

<p>Time fails to tell what we see. It seems to me
it would be easier to tell what we didn’t see; I
guess it wouldn’t take so long, but I will desist.</p>

<p>But a few memories stand out shinin’ amidst the
bewilderin’ maze. One of ’em is standin’ in the cell
of Savonarola, that noble creeter, raised up to the
pinnakle of saintship by the fickle populace, who
knelt and worshipped him, and then so soon crucified
him. And he all the time a-keepin’ on stiddy,
jest as good and noble and riz up as he could be.
Yes, his last words to his persecutors gin a good
idee on him&mdash;</p>

<p>“You can turn me out of earthly meeting-houses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</span>but you can’t keep me out of the Heavenly
one.”</p>

<p>I may not have used the same words he did, but
it wuz to that effect. I had a sight of emotions as
I stood in that narrer place that once confined the
form of that kingly creeter.</p>

<p>And then the tomb of Galileo. I always liked
him the best that ever wuz. He wuz also persecuted
for knowin’ things that them round him
didn’t know, and thinkin’ thoughts and seein’ sights
that they didn’t. And in order to git along with
’em round him, he had to promise to stop teachin’
the truth. The Majority had to be appeased by
the old Ignorance. It has to now, time and agin.
But he kep’ on a-sayin’ to himself, and out loud, when
he got a chance to&mdash;“The world duz move.” Men
and wimmen to-day, who feel some as Galileo
about men’s and wimmen’s rights&mdash;licenses, the
higher spiritual knowledge&mdash;they keep on a-sayin’
all the time, every time that they can git a chance
to edge a word in between Ignorance and Bigotry
and shaky-kneed Custom, who stand all shackled
together with mouldy old chains of prejudice, every
time they can git a openin’ between these tattlin’,
but hard-lived old creeters, they keep on a-sayin’&mdash;“The
world <i>duz</i> move.”</p>

<p>Folks will fall in with ’em after a time, jest as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</span>they fell in with the idees of Galileo; now they persecute
’em.</p>

<p>But more interestin’ to me than the glories and
marvels of the Medician Chapel, the Pitti and
Uffizi galleries, the Boboli Gardens, the monument
to Dante (smart creeter <i>he</i> wuz, and went
through a sight from first to last; he and she both&mdash;Beatrice,
I mean)&mdash;</p>

<p>But of fur more interest to me it wuz to stand in
the house where the slender little English woman
dwelt while her soul was slightly imprisoned in her
frail body, while she held “The poet’s star-tuned
harp to sweep.” And where at last “God struck a
silence through it all, and gave to His beloved
sleep.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sleep, sweet belovéd, we sometimes say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet have no tune to charm away</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But never doleful dream again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall break their happy slumber when</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He giveth His belovéd sleep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, she sleeps well now. All the melancholy
and charm of Italy, all its magnificence, all of its
splendor, its ruins&mdash;all seem to be centred in that
one little room. I had emotions there that it hain’t
no use dwellin’ on.</p>

<p>Figgers seemed to start up and bagon to me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</span>from every side. Aurora Leigh, with her sad,
sweet smile, stood in front of me with that lover of
hern; the Portuguese lovers, with hearts of fire and
dew too; the “Poet Mother” holdin’ her two boys
to her heart, knit to that heart by ties of iron;
Nino and Guido, little babies, teaching ’em to&mdash;“Say
<i>first</i> the word country,” after that mother
and love. Then I see her alone in the house&mdash;<i>alone</i>.</p>

<p>“God, how the house feels!”</p>

<p>While Guido and Nino lay dead, shot down by
the balls of the enemy&mdash;“One by the East Sea and
by the West”&mdash;then she remembered that she
had learnt ’em to say <i>first</i> the word “country,”
puttin’ it before “mother and home.”</p>

<p>She wuz kinder sorry she’d done it at first, I
guess. She forgot Glory and Patriotism, for this
woman&mdash;this “Who was agonized here, the East
Sea and West Sea rhymed on in her head, forever
instead.”</p>

<p>She couldn’t think of anything else, only the
mightiness of human love and grief.</p>

<p>I don’t blame her; I should felt jest so myself if
it had been Thomas Jefferson shot down. What
would the glory of Jonesville be to me, if his bright,
understandin’, affectionate eyes wuz closed in death?
I, too, should think that everything else wuz “imbecile,
hewin’ out roads to a wall.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</span></p>
<p>How black that wall would look to me!</p>

<p>And then the cry of the Human, how it rung
in my ears&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be pitiful, O God!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, indeed, in how many crysises have I felt the
hite and the depth of that cry!</p>

<p>I had powerful emotions, powerful, and sights of
’em&mdash;so did Al Faizi. He jest doted on Mrs.
Browning’s poetry, and he sot a good deal of store
by the poetry of her relict&mdash;her widderer. And
Robert duz write first-rate, but pretty deep, some
on ’em. I’ve grown real riz up and breathless
a-hearin’ Thomas J. read about “How they brought
the good news from Ghent to Aix.” And I love
to hear Thomas J. read about the “Lost Leader,”
and beautiful “Evelyn Hope,” and etc., etc. But, on
the hull, I sot more store by the poems of his wife.</p>

<p>But, as I say, I always respected and admired
Elizabeth’s widderer. He insisted on marryin’ the
woman he loved, no matter how poor health she
enjoyed. I presoom his folks objected and thought
that Robert would do better to marry a woman
that wuz enjoyin’ better health. But he never
thought of doctors’ bills or poultices&mdash;things that
fill up littler minds&mdash;no, indeed! nor she didn’t
either. They felt only the supreme joy of congenial
minds and hearts, and love that lifts the soul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</span>up to the divinest hites mortals can ever stand
up on.</p>

<p>She says, and it seems almost like liftin’ a veil
before the Holy of Holys, and as if I ortn’t to
speak of it, but I will venter&mdash;</p>

<p>She sez:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“First time he kissed me, he but kissed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This hand wherewith I write,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever since it grew more fair and white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slow to world greetings, quick with its Oh, list!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the angels speak.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How the words fell from her innocent soul, and
how they must always reach the same place in ’em
who hear ’em, if they have got souls!</p>

<p>Yes, in readin’ her poetry you can see that, as she
sed about the dead baby and its sorrerin’ ma, that
“The crystal bars shine faint between the souls of
child and mother.” You can see that the veil wuz
but thin indeed between her soul and the Heaven
she writes of&mdash;yes, you can almost see its light
a-shinin’ through the words, and its music almost
throbs through her sweet thoughts.</p>

<p>But to resoom. It seems almost like a beautiful
dream to look back on’t, with, of course, some
shadders to make the brightness seem more bright,
the time we spent in Florence. One day while we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</span>wuz there we rid out to see the Tower of Pisa&mdash;Martin
sed it would be expected of him to see it.</p>

<p>We found that Pisa wuz a dretful noisy place&mdash;dretful,
and, somehow, yellin’ in a foreign language
seems worse than the same yellin’ in Yankee.
Howsumever, I spoze these yellers and jabberers
knew their own business.</p>

<div class="figright illowp46" id="i_599" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_599.jpg" alt="Leaning Tower of Pisa" />
</div>

<p>Josiah sed, as we looked up at the tower, sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ve always took me to task, Samantha, about
my corn-house bein’ built kinder tippin’ and tottlin’.
Now what do you think? This tips as much agin,
and folks can’t think too much on’t, so it seems.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “it has a different look to it from
your edifice. I believe that will fall on you some
day, Josiah Allen, and be the death on you.”</p>

<p>“Wall, they hain’t either on ’em fell yet; they
both stand kinder tippin’, but I don’t worry about
either on ’em&mdash;we knew what we wuz about when
we built ’em.”</p>

<p>He ranked ’em both right in together, I see that
he did. But this tower goes fur ahead of his edifice&mdash;fur,
though it is some seven hundred years older.</p>

<p>It is perfectly round, the sides all fixed off in
rows of pillows, and the hull thing most two hundred
feet high.</p>

<p>I didn’t hanker for goin’ up to the top on’t&mdash;no,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</span>indeed! It tuckers me enough to go up into our
wood-house chamber, about twenty odd steps. I
wuzn’t goin’ to trail up three hundred steps&mdash;no,
indeed!</p>

<p>But Martin sed that he would like to say that
he had been there. So he toiled up the ascent, and
so did Alice. And she sed that the view from the
top wuz perfectly wonderful, takin’ in the beautiful
country all round&mdash;cities, picteresque villages, and
the blue waters of the Mediterranean twelve milds
away.</p>

<p>And Martin sed that if that tower wuz in
Chicago, with a outside elevator let down from
the top to take folks up, and a cigar-stand and
saloon on top, a man ort to clear five thousand
dollars a year from it. And he sed the white
marble it’s built on would make splendid mantlepieces,
and he told how many it would make&mdash;I
can’t remember, but a immense lot on ’em.</p>

<p>He’d figgered ’em up on the tower; he took his
pencil out and figgered it up on the pinnakle, so,
for all he realized, the entrancin’ view below might
have been our four-acre paster or a huckleberry
patch. We didn’t stay here long. Of course, we
had to see the cathedral and Baptistery, great
buildin’s built of white marble, and all ornamented
off on the outside to as great an extent as I ever
see, or ever expect to, and the Campo Santa has
got frescoes in it that are beautiful beyend any tellin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</span>
on.</p>

<p>There is lots of other things there that is worth
seein’&mdash;the Museum, the University, the Aqueduct,
etc.&mdash;but we didn’t stay to see em all, Martin, as
usual, a-bein’ in a great hurry; but he sed that he
wanted to say, of course, that he had paid proper
attention to this city, which wuz one of the oldest
in Europe. Before John the Baptist came preachin’
in the Wilderness this wuz a Roman town. It
beats all! No wonder it’s a noisy old place&mdash;it has
seen lots of trouble.</p>

<p>In goin’ out of it we went through so many tunnels,
it skairt me most to death, and Josiah wuz
skairt, too, though he wouldn’t own up to it, but I
heard him sithe repeatedly; otherwise I wuz glad
to go.</p>

<p>Wall, as I say, what I see in beautiful Florence
can’t be told, and the enchantin’ seenery in the
Valley of the Arno. The beautiful Casino, which
even Martin admitted come almost up to Central
Park (it is fur bigger and handsomer, though I
wouldn’t want the Central Park folks to know I
sed it, for it would be apt to mad ’em. It made
Martin mad as a hen when I suggested it).</p>

<p>Why, when the Loontown Opera House wuz
finished, we Jonesvillians hung our heads considerable
before the Loontowners, they wuz so hauty
over it. Two hundred could set down in it all to
one time.</p>

<p>It danted us. We envied ’em. But what would
them proud Loontowners think of a theatre that
would seat eighty thousand, and probble twenty
or thirty thousand more could have squoze in
while they wuz a-performin’.</p>

<p>One hundred thousand all assembled,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</span>
mebby to look down on the dretful sight of seein’
men kill each other. That wuz the thought that riz
up my head-dress, and almost busted my bask waist.
To think that men and wimmen could meet for
amusement, and witness sech agony and sufferin’,
and probble laugh at it. Why, in one of their
meetin’s, twelve hundred men wuz killed, wimmen
lookin’ on, too, jest as well as men, and probble
snickerin’ over it.</p>

<p>I would be ashamed of myself if I wuz in their
places&mdash;heartless creeters! If I’d been there at the
time nobody could kep’ me from givin’ ’em a piece
of my mind. But I wuz eighteen hundred years
too young; they kep’ right at it.</p>

<p>Al Faizi wuz dretful interested in this place. He
writ down lots in that book of hisen. He see
sights here he never see in his own land&mdash;religion
or no religion.</p>

<p>Christians throwed round to let lions and tigers
devour ’em! The idee! He looked curous as a
dog while he talked with me about it.</p>

<p>Martin wuz kinder calculatin’ on how many grain
elevators the stun would build if they wuz landed
in Chicago.</p>

<p>And Josiah and the children were wanderin’
round, and he acted tired and fagged out. He wuz,
as usual, hungry. He sed prowlin’ round amongst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</span>
them stun heaps gin him a appetite. And I spoze
it did. But, then, I’ve known settin’ still to whet
up his appetite, and barn chores, and everything.</p>

<p>But we prowled round here for some time, and
there is one big, vivid memory that I brung away
from Rome; it stands up in my foretop some as
in Naples Mount Vesuvius stands, with the Bay of
Naples a-layin’ placid and fair at its treacherous old
feet.</p>

<p>The treasures of the Vatican (which makes my
brain reel and my feet kinder ache to this day when
I think of ’em), the biggest palace in the world, so
I spoze. And then St. Peter’s Church, more’n five
times as big as the big Catholic Cathedral in New
York&mdash;two hundred and twelve thousand feet; we
can’t hardly understand it, it is so big.</p>

<p>But Martin kep’ us there more’n half an hour;
for, as he sed, he wanted to git a thorough idee of
it, so that he wouldn’t have to come agin. Sez he:</p>

<p>“I travel as I do everything else; I do it laboriously
and thoroughly.”</p>

<p>Wall, mebby he did, but I carried away from St.
Peter’s and the Vatican, which is jest by the side
on’t, a sort of a dizzy, achin’ memory of pillows and
picters and statutes and illimitable space, and picters
and carvin’s and statutes, and statutes and carvin’s
and picters&mdash;a few of which stands out prominent&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</span>Laocoon, the Apollo Belvidere (he wuz as
handsome as Thomas Jefferson, and that is sayin’
all I can say), and the Annunciation, and the Transfiguration
by Raphael, and great picters by Da
Vinci and Murillo. Picters, statutes, mosaics, carvin’s,
chapels, altars, picters, etc., etc., etc., etc.,
etc., and I might go on so all day, but I won’t.</p>

<p>Why, the treasures of art in the Vatican is the
finest collection in the world, and when you realize
how big the world is&mdash;take it from Jonesville to
Chicago, and so by New York to Ingy, and back
agin by the North Pole to Loontown and Zoar,
you can git a faint idee on’t.</p>

<p>There is everything in it besides the glorious picters
and statutes made by the greatest artists and
sculpters that ever lived. There are ancient coins
and household utensils of every age, tapestry,
mosaics, jewels, embroideries, carvin’s, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Why, imagine what treasures of art could be put
into these ten thousand rooms by onlimited wealth
and power through hundreds of years, and then see if
you expect anybody is a-goin’ to describe ’em; specially
if they are hurried on by a Martin, and goaded
on the right and the left by the hungry groanin’s of a
Josiah, and the endless questions of a child of
eight.</p>

<p>Al Faizi got considerable good out on’t, I guess.</p>

<p>He writ down a lot, I see, in that delicate, small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</span>
handwritin’ of hisen&mdash;I d’no but it is shorthand.</p>

<p>Alice, I spoze, see on every side a face, jest as
young eyes will, when young hearts are full of love
and hope.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin sed he must see the catacombs, and
I felt, too, that I must go, although I knew it wuz
resky. I felt that with his ardent temperament and
his eager search after ontried paths, I more’n
mistrusted that I should lose Josiah Allen for good
in them catacombs. But I ventered, after layin’
stringent rules onto that small, but ambitious man.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Don’t you lose sight of me through the
day, Josiah Allen!”</p>

<p>“How can I see you in the dark?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Foller my voice!” sez I.</p>

<p>“That’s an easy job,” sez he; “I could foller that
for years and years, and not lose a minute.”</p>

<p>I d’no what he meant; he wuz excited and kinder
wanderin’ in his mind, I believe.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">The guides went ahead with flarin’ lights.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, when we descended into the bowels of the
earth, I felt queer, queer as a dog. The guides went
ahead, with flarin’ lights held up to guide us, and as
we proceeded onwards through what seemed to be
milds and milds of underground rooms and halls
and windin’ ways, the thought come, and I couldn’t
keep it out of my mind&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</span></p>
<p>“What if the light should blow out, as I’ve seen
so many lights do in my day, and we should be
doomed to forever more wander here, and die at
last fur from Jonesville, and the light of day. But
as I whispered to Josiah&mdash;</p>

<p>“We shall die together at least, which will be a
comfort.”</p>

<p>He, too, felt the pathos and danger of the seen,
and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hurry up, or the guide will be out of sight!”
and he added almost tenderly, “You’re too fat,
Samantha, to take many sech trips.”</p>

<p>And I sez, “Wall, I don’t expect to travel habitually
under the ground.”</p>

<p>And we had some words. It madded me considerable
to be twitted of my heft both on top of the
ground and in the bowels of the earth, till I recollected
where I wuz and what had once gone on
here; then a deep or took holt on me, and I sez
to myself&mdash;</p>

<p>“What must the Christians have felt who fled
here for safety from persecution and death! What
did the saints and martyrs think on as they jined in
their hymns of praise and victory? A few pounds
of flesh, more or less, what would they have thought
on’t, or the teasin’ words of their pardners? No,
lions and tigers and the headsman’s axe wuz what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</span>wuz before their eyes, and, what wuz worse, before
the eyes of ’em they loved best.”</p>

<p>Endless rooms, so it seemed to me, we went
through, narrer passages and chambers, arched overhead,
and the walls lined, some on ’em with dead
bodies. Mummies, tombs, picters, windin’ ways,
Josiah, Martin, torches&mdash;them wuz the idees that
come back to me as I think on’t now.</p>

<p>Wall, Josiah wuz dretful impressed with the Holy
Staircase, up which the members of the meetin’-house
went on their knees, a-sayin’ their prayers as
they went, and it wuz a impressive sight to look way
up the stairs and see the bretheren and sistern
a-creepin’ up and a-fingerin’ their strings of beads
and a-prayin’ to the Virgin Mary or some other
saint or ’postle, mebby.</p>

<p>And here I had another trial with my dear, but
too ardent and impressible pardner. He looked
on in deep thought for anon or a little longer,
and then he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Samantha, wouldn’t it be uneek for you and
me to climb up the steps of the Jonesville meetin’-house
a-sayin’ over some hymn, or one of the
Sams? And you could take your mother’s gold
string of beads, and I could buy a string of glass
ones for two or three cents, or I could make a
string with a little of Ury’s help&mdash;whittle ’em out
of wood. And how impressive it would be! how
it would attract attention to us! how foreign it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</span>
would look, and show plain how travelled and cultivated
we wuz! You know, folks that come
home from Europe always bring lots of strange
ways with ’em and airs; and this would be one
of the most uneekest and impressive that wuz ever
brung into Jonesville or America.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Gin up that idee to once, Josiah Allen,
for I will never jine in with it in the world. The
idee!” sez I, “that you and me, with our age and
our rumatiz, should go a-creepin’ up on our knees into
the meetin’-house. Why, to say nothin’ of spilein’
our clothes, our knee-pans wouldn’t be good for
nothin’ after one venter.” Sez I, “The pans would be
perfectly useless forever afterwards, and,” sez I,
“what good would it do? The aid we invoke
hain’t bought with beads. The God we worship
hain’t reached by creepin’ up a pair of stairs; He is
right with us to the foot of the stairs or anywhere.
Give up the idee immegiately and to once.”</p>

<p>He acted real fraxious, but I drawed his attention
off, and mebby he’ll forgit it.</p>

<p>The beauty of Naples has been sed and sung in so
many different words and tunes that it don’t need
the pen or voice of a Samantha, specially as I hain’t
much of a singer, nor wuzn’t even in my young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</span>days, so I will be content with singin’ to myself at
times a rapt sort of a soul song, as I look back on
the enchantin’ beauty of the Bay of Naples.</p>

<p>Beautiful for situation indeed is Naples! clusterin’
round the clear, blue waters, that sweep round in
a sort of a crescent.</p>

<p>The city occupies the centre&mdash;the inside on’t, little
villages and tree-embowered castles and villas a-linin’
the shores on each side, and on the off side, addin’
the one touch of mystery that gives a vivid but dark
charm to the picter, rises Mount Vesuvius, a-standin’
there all the time as if protestin’ aginst the poor
wisdom of the ages.</p>

<p>Who knows what’s a-goin’ on in her insides?
Who knows what she’s mad about? Who knows
what makes her act so puggicky, and every now and
then bust out into blood-red indignation, that carries
death and ruin all round her? Queer, hain’t it?</p>

<p>Queer, that havin’ in mind jest what she’s done
and is liable to do any time agin, that men and
wimmen go on, gay and happy, and lean up aginst
her old feet, and nestle down in her shadder, and
build homes of love there, liable any minute to be
swep’ away by her red-hot wrath!</p>

<p>Passin’ strange! jest as singular as it is to think
all of us in Jonesville and the world at large will
build fair homes of love and content, and anchor
’em to livin’ hearts alone, in the same world where
Death is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</span></p>

<p>But to resoom. My recollections of this city,
like so many others, is one vast paneramy, framed
in by the blue Mediterranean, and ornamented on
top by Vesuvius, of picter galleries, tall palaces,
broad avenues, narrer streets, in which we see many
seens that in Jonesville is kep’ under cover, and
stately castles&mdash;sights and sights of castles, and immense
ones; seems as if they wuz immenser and
more numerous than in any other city I see on my
tower, and fountains, and aqueducts, and churches,
and colleges, and theatres, and operas, etc., etc., etc.
Plenty of chances for bein’ good, and plenty of
modes of recreations, the Neapolitans have, and
they seem to take advantage on ’em all. But it
seemed as if I couldn’t never forgit that tall, warnin’
figger that looms up forever in the background.
But, then, agin, mebby I should; I forgit the graveyard
in Jonesville lots of times, though I ride by it
every Sunday to meetin’.</p>

<p>The guide wanted us to go up Vesuvius. He
said she wuz lookin’ very mild and pleasant, and it
would be perfectly safe.</p>

<p>But I didn’t like her looks, or that is, I thought
I’d ruther admire her at a distance, some as I would
a striped tiger right out of the jungle. But Vesuvius
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</span>did indeed look beautiful, a-risin’ up above the
incomparable Bay of Naples. But I felt for all her
good looks I didn’t want to tackle her.</p>

<p>I knew what she’d done in the past to ’em that
trusted her too much. Pompey won’t forgit her&mdash;no,
indeed! After eighteen hundred years have gone
don’t memories hant the House of Pansa and the
hull of that devoted city of what Vesuvius can do
when it gits to actin’? Yes, indeed, indeed! No, I
didn’t want to venter.</p>

<p>But I did want to visit that city that has lain
buried up in the earth for so many years. And
Martin sed that most all of his inflooential friends
made a practice of goin’ there. So we all sot off one
pleasant mornin’&mdash;my Josiah in pretty good sperits,
for we had had an oncommon good breakfust, and
Alice lookin’ sweet as a flower, and Al Faizi a-knowin’
she did, a-realizin’ her sweetness through all his
bein’, as I could see from his big, dark, sad eyes, that
wuz bent on her all the way, and her heart all filled
up with another’s image and drawin’ her radiant
looks from that sun of her heart.</p>

<p>O human hearts; O glory and sadness and
rapter that fills ’em! How many jest sech gay
young sperits, sech souls, full of the glowin’ rapter of
love, the divine sadness of love, went out in darkness
on that dretful day, a thousand and a half years ago!</p>

<p>I had fearful riz-up emotions before I got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</span>
Pompey, jest a-thinkin’ on’t, and so what could they
have been when I at last stood in the city on which
fell sech a sudden doom.</p>

<p>To see the silent forms struck down, jest as full
of life and love and happiness as Alice and Adrian
wuz to-day. There wuz a woman clingin’ to a bag
of gold&mdash;gold couldn’t help her. A young man
and young girl clasped in each others’ arms&mdash;love
couldn’t save ’em. A priest of Isis, who knew all
the secrets of the Mystic Religion&mdash;his wisdom
couldn’t save him, or what he called his wisdom.
A giant form full of courage and defiance&mdash;strength
couldn’t save him, nor courage. A high-born lady
covered with jewels&mdash;wealth and high station
couldn’t save her.</p>

<p>They all had to bear the common fate, as well as
the little maid who died runnin’ away from death,
and had covered her face with her garments, she
wuz so ’fraid. Poor little creeter! what if it had
been Babe?</p>

<p>No; the prisoners shet up in jail, riveted to the
rock, the dogs, horses, goats, even the poor little
dove, that wouldn’t leave her nest, pretty, little affectionate
thing!&mdash;all, all had to bear the doom that
come down upon ’em on that dretful day.</p>

<p>All on ’em a-doin’ their usual work, jest as if the
Heavens should open and pour down a avalanche
of ashes and bury us up in our home in Jonesville&mdash;Josiah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</span>
a-doin’ his barn chores, and I a-washin’
dishes, and both on us full of life and joy of livin’.
Besides Ury and Philury.</p>

<p>Oh, dear me! oh, dear me suz!</p>

<p>Wall, I went through them streets, so many centuries
buried and forgot, in a state of mind I can’t
describe. It seemed some like goin’ through any
city. The streets wuz middlin’ narrer, but the housen
stood on each side; good roads wore down by the
steps of the multitude. So wuz the fountains that
stood on every hand; you could see where the lips
of the public had wore ’em away. Palaces, little
housen, shops, temples, amphitheatres. One house
we went through looked as though it had been built
yesterday for some rich American; it wuz over three
hundred feet long and over a hundred feet broad,
and all ornamented off beautiful with statutes and
mosaics and things good enough for a Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>In some things the old inhabitants did better
than they do now. They had sidewalks&mdash;pretty
narrer, but fur better than none&mdash;and more facilities
for gittin’ water. I wish the Italians used
more now&mdash;they would feel as well agin for it, jest
as Josiah duz when I can git him to use it free.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Mr. Goldwind, one of
Martin’s business rivals.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, in the streets of Naples Martin met a man
that he knew at home&mdash;a man most as rich as
Martin&mdash;a Mr. Goldwind, a sort of a rival in business,
I guess, and he had jest been
travellin’ through Spain.</p>

<p>And what should P. Martyn Smythe
do but proclaim it to us that evenin’
that we wuz to go to Spain.</p>

<p>I hearn him say to Alice&mdash;“It will
be asked of me if we have been there.
Gertrude Goldwind will ask you if
you have been there. Alice, we must
be able to say ‘Yes.’ So we will start
immegiately. I have got to go back
to Paris anyway on important business.”</p>

<p>So the next day we started for Paris.</p>

<p>As I have sed heretofore, Martin wuz a very
enthusiastick and ambitious traveller; that is, he
wanted to tell what he’d seen in foreign lands,
whether he’d seen ’em or not; but he wuz ambitious
to have his body trailed through ’em. And
it made it very good and instructive for me, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</span>
wearisome, for, of course, the more you see, the
more you know, and he had to take the hull circus
with him wherever he went. And when he promulgated
the wild idee that we wuz to go to
Spain, I acquiesced immegiately and to once,
and after a private interview I held with Josiah,
he did.</p>

<p>Sez Martin&mdash;“We won’t make a long stay there;
but we will go over the Pyrenees anyway, and step
onto the soil; and when we go back to America it
can’t be said by any one that we did not see Spain.”</p>

<p>Oh, how different folkses key-notes is! Now,
the key-note to his character wuz&mdash;what would
folks say?&mdash;the outside of the platter; while, as for
me, my key-note wuz&mdash;what I could see and learn,
and what wuz inside of the platter. And that wuz
Al Faizi’s key-note, only his key wuz stronger and
deeper even than mine. Josiah and the children
had their own keys and notes, which it is needless
to peticularize.</p>

<p>Wall, I had become some acquainted with Spain
through my friend, Washington Irving, and Mr.
Bancroft, and then I wuz quite familar with its
literature. I had learned at a early age one of its
poems, runnin’ thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When it rains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do as they do in Spain&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let it rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I had often hearn and repeated this national
epick to my relief and consolation on stormy days.
And though I felt that our trip bid fair to be a
hasty and sweepin’ one, yet I felt that if I could
jest stand on the top of the Pyrenees, and look
down into the land, I would like it, even if I did
not step my foot into it.</p>

<p>So, after stayin’ a short time in Paris&mdash;for Martin
to do his errents there, I spoze&mdash;we sot sail for
Spain, and the first night come to the river
Garonne, and acrost the long bridge into Bordeaux.</p>

<p>We stayed all night there, and the next mornin’
bright and early sot out agin. A little after noon
we come to Pau. The train stopped down by the
river Gave, a river that rushes right out of the
mountains. Above that, a hundred feet high, on a
terrace lookin’ south, stands the city.</p>

<p>And what a view busted onto my vision as I
looked out of the winder at the hotel! Them
gleamin’, silent peaks of snow are camped round
Pau like tall, silent, white-robed pickets a-guardin’
Pau from danger.</p>

<p>What a sight! what a sight!</p>

<p>But Martin, anxious to see <span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</span>everything that could
be seen, sot off most the first thing to see the castle&mdash;one
of the grandest in France&mdash;where Henry
IV. wuz born, and I spoze they enjoyed it, for Josiah
went with him.</p>

<p>But what I wanted to see wuz the fountain of
Lourdes. And though Martin and Josiah kinder
made light of me, they seemed willin’ enough to go
with me the next day. It is only a two hours’ ride
from Pau to this most famous place of pilgrimage
in Europe. And we sot off in good sperits. It
lays down at the foot of the mountain, in a deep
valley. At one end of the village is a grotto where
a young girl, years ago, received a visit from the
Virgin Mary, or she sez that she did. She told the
story to her folks and to all the neighbors, and
she stuck to the same story all her life till she died.</p>

<p>Of course ’em that went to the same place and
didn’t see nothin’&mdash;they didn’t believe her.</p>

<p>I d’no as Abraham’s folks believed him when he
sed that he had had a visit from angels. I dare
presoom to say some of his relations didn’t&mdash;his
cousins now, and his mother-in-law’s folks; I dare
say they sed they wuz a-lookin’ right that way at
the very time and didn’t see a thing&mdash;Abraham must
have been mistaken; and they would add most probble&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</span></p>
<p>“Abraham’s eyes are a-failin’; he ort to wear
stronger specs.”</p>

<p>Not a-thinkin’ that their stronger specs could
never give ’em a glimpse of the things that he see;
for speritual things are speritually discerned, and
we all have gifts differin’. Why should a propheysier
try to dream dreams and see visions?</p>

<p>Wall, finally the priests gin out that the story
wuz true, but whether their consciences wuz good
in ginin’ it out I d’no&mdash;I don’t keep their consciences
in a box in my bureau draw.</p>

<p>But tenny rate, the first six months one hundred
and fifty thousand pilgrims visited the spot and partook
of the healin’ water of the spring that flowed
out of the grotto.</p>

<p>And pretty soon a lofty meetin’-house riz up over
that grotto. The grounds round it are laid out like
a immense waterin’-place that must prepare for the
comin’ of a multitude without number. In the season
of pilgrimage the meetin’-house is crowded all
day and way into the night, and round it the way
is blocked with the pilgrims, and way up onto the
hillside their kneelin’ forms are massed.</p>

<p>What a seen it must be in still nights, that immense
kneelin’ throng and vast procession a-movin’
up the hill and a-carryin’ torches and a-singin’ thrillin’
hymns!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</span></p>
<p>Inside, the meetin’-house wuz richly decorated,
its high arches festooned with banners, and the
walls covered with memorials of gratitude for cures
performed there.</p>

<p>Martin walked round with his hands in his pockets
and his head up. I don’t believe he sensed anything
of the sperit of the place, nor Josiah.</p>

<p>Nor down in the grotto either, as we stood by
that miracolous fountain and see a-hangin’ all round
us the crutches of the paryaletics and cripples who
had been cured here and walked off with no use for
’em any more.</p>

<p>I don’t believe them two men took any more realizin’
sense of what they wuz a-seein’.</p>

<p>Josiah drinked a cup of the water, and sez he in
a pert tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“That is the best water I’ve drinked sence I left
Jonesville. I wish I could take a kag with me&mdash;it
tastes like the spring down by the Beaver Medder
in Jonesville.”</p>

<p>And Martin drinked his cupful, and sed he preferred
Apollinaris water.</p>

<p>Neither of them men realized its virtues.</p>

<p>But I sez to my pardner&mdash;“Josiah Allen, don’t
you know that this water heals the sick, makes the
lame walk, and the blind see? Don’t you realize it
as you ort to, Josiah Allen?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</span></p>
<p>“Oh,” sez he, “I don’t feel any peticular difference
in my feelin’s; I feel jest about the same.”</p>

<p>And Martin sed he thought it wuz imagination
mostly. Sez he, “You know in sudden danger
cripples have been known to walk off; it is the
power of their religious fervor that performs the
cure.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “you can call it what you please,
but it is a good thing anyway that cures ’em.” Sez
I, “I dare presoom to say that they feel like sayin’
as they walk off and look round&mdash;‘One thing I
know, whereas I was blind, now I see,’ and they
feel like leapin’ and praisin’ the power that has
healed ’em.”</p>

<p>Martin kep’ his hands in his pockets and looked
onbelievin’, but I see that my talk wuz impressin’
my beloved companion, and he whispered to me
while Martin’s back wuz turned&mdash;“Do you spoze,
Samantha, that it would be apt to cure that corn of
mine? I’m most tempted to try it.”</p>

<p>I sez, “Have you the faith, Josiah Allen?”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">I have faith that it aches like

</div>

<p>Sez I, “Do you believe that the water could heal
it? If you hain’t got faith I wouldn’t take off my
shue;” for my ardent companion wuz even then
a-onbuttonin’ the top button.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</span></p>
<p>He paused. “But,” sez he, “would I have to
leave my shue here if I got cured&mdash;would it be fashionable
and stylish to do so, and go home barefooted?”</p>

<p>And I swep’ right by him, and sez I, “Come on,
Josiah Allen; all the water of Lourdes can’t cure a
soul whose highest aim is to be stylish.”</p>

<p>And he come on a-mutterin’, “You complain if I
don’t look ahead, and you complain if I do. How
did I know whether it would be expected of me to
go home in my stockin’ feet or not, and you’d complain
if I got a hole in my stockin’.” Sez he, “If I
hain’t healed you complain, and if I be healed you
find fault with me.”</p>

<p>Sez I soothin’ly, “Dear Josiah, you might git
cold in your stockin’ feet&mdash;it is all for the best, and
I d’no its power over corns anyway,” sez I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “it would look queer to Pau to
see me mount the hotel steps with one shue and
one red stockin’ on.”</p>

<p>For he had worn his dressiest pair
that mornin’.</p>

<p>And he murmured, “If I had my
dressin’-gown on, it would droop down
over my feet some.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi had been all this time a-lookin’
round and notin’ down things in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</span>note-book, and seein’ everything with his deep,
strange eyes, but sayin’ little about it, and a-thinkin’
a lot, as wuz his general way.</p>

<p>The next mornin’ we left Pau, and in the afternoon
we found ourselves in the “Bay of Biscay,
Oh!”</p>

<p>That is a quotation from a poem&mdash;in common
talk the “Oh” can be omitted.</p>

<p>We had to wait a spell at Bayonne for the train
to take us into Spain, though Martin proposed
that we should take a carriage and drive out to
Biarritz.</p>

<p>For Martin sed that so many of his acquaintances
went there for the winter that it would sound
better for us to say that we had passed some time
there&mdash;it would be far more stylish and fashionable
to say it.</p>

<p>“How long a time can you pass there,” sez I,
“to git back to ketch the train?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez he, “we shall have time to stay three
fourths of an hour&mdash;ample time to see everything
of interest there.”</p>

<p>Good land!!!!!</p>

<p>But Martin wuz the head of the procession, as
you may say, and we had to foller on where he went
and halt when he halted.</p>

<p>And I felt that one thing wuz favorable to me, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</span>always had a faculty for seein’ a good deal in a
short space of time by the clock.</p>

<p>Biarritz is a pleasant place in the winter, and you
could see that a good many have discovered it by
the number of big hotels perched up on the bluffs,
their open winders lookin’ south.</p>

<p>Of course Martin had to drive by the Villa
Eugenia, occupied by her who once had a empire
to command, and beauty, youth, and love, and now
sits and looks over the tombs and the ruins of the
hull on ’em.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! I always felt onreconciled to that
bright young boy of hern bein’ struck down as he
wuz by a savage in a savage place, fur from a
mother’s love.</p>

<p>Oh, dear me!</p>

<p>But here Napoleon came often in the mild September,
and happiness rained in the beautiful villa,
with its gay pleasure grounds.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin see a sight, I spoze, and as he sed
a-goin’ back:</p>

<p>“I am so glad we stayed here some time, for I
know a lot of men who bring their families here
winters, and it will be interesting to converse with
them about the beauties of the place; I’m glad I
brought all my family with me,” sez he, lookin’
complacently at Alice and Adrian.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</span></p>
<p>“But, papa, we never sat down at all,” sed
Adrian.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my boy&mdash;you have been there,
and it is a great watering-place. And when Mr.
Goldwind’s boy talks about Biarritz, you can mention
to him that you have been there and stayed for
some time.”</p>

<p>“But Billy Goldwind stays there all winter,
papa.”</p>

<p>“Well, we do not want to stay so long; we want
to get back home before winter. We merely wanted
to go there and stay some time, and we have.”</p>

<p>Wall, I don’t spoze it wuz a real lie&mdash;we had been
there and had stayed some time.</p>

<p>Josiah sed he had stayed as long as he wanted to,
and he should be glad to git into Spain with his
dressin’-gown on, and set down a spell.</p>

<p class="h2sub">CATHEDRALS AND CASTLES IN SPAIN.</p>

<p>I wuz not sorry to be on the train agin on our
way to Irun, which wuz the first town of Spain we
entered, and here we wuz ushered into the Custom
House.</p>

<p>Our baggage wuz all took into the station and
spread out on long counters and examined.</p>

<p>Politer creeters I don’t want to see than them
Spaniards wuz. And the language they spoke
amongst themselves wuz as soft as silk and as
kinder soothin’ and sweet. And they didn’t hurt
our baggage a speck, though Josiah’s anxiety as
they opened his satchel wuz extreme.</p>

<p>He sez to me, “Like as not they’ll spile that
dressin’-gown.”</p>

<p>“How could they spile it?” I whispered back.</p>

<p>“Why,” sez he, “them tossels could be hurt easy.
I shall have to comb ’em out agin as quick as we
stop.”</p>

<p>He had a awful coarse comb with him, and he
did spend hours a-combin’ out them red tossels that
he ort to spend on his own head, or on his Bible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</span></p>
<p>So, as I say, he jest hovered over that satchel
and heaved 2 or 3 deep sithes of relief as the
Custom House officer released it from his hand.</p>

<p>And, oh! how lovin’ly he folded
the rep folds, and laid the tossels
down caressin’ly.</p>

<p>My baggage was soon and hurridly
gone through&mdash;in the words
of a old adage concernin’ a horse,
changed to suit the occasion&mdash;“A
short satchel is soon hurried.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards are a lazy set&mdash;I
guess they would have examined
our things closter, if they wuzn’t so
slow and slack.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>A smile of admiration
swep’ over his dark
visage.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I see one of the officials take up
one of my sheep’s-head nightcaps
that lay on top&mdash;so’s to not muss
the agin’&mdash;he took it up, and a
smile of admiration swep’ over his
dark visage. I believe, if he hadn’t
been so lazy, he would have asked me for the pattern
on’t. More’n as likely as not, so lackin’ is
Spain in some of the first elements of the ingregiencies
of civilization, I shouldn’t wonder a mite
if them two wuz the only sheep’s-head nightcaps
in Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</span></p>

<p>But this last fact (his laziness) conquered his
gropin’s after sunthin’ new and better than he and
his companion had known in the way of nightcaps.
He laid it down with another smile of admiration,
and closed up my satchel.</p>

<p>Wall, after we got on the cars agin, bag and
baggage, and I thought, my soul, owin’ to the utter
shiftlessness and slowness, that we never should git
fairly to goin’.</p>

<p>After Josiah wuz set at rest agin concernin’ his
dressin’-gown, and I settled down about my nightcap,
little did I think that we should have to go
through the hull performance agin in a few hours.</p>

<p>But we did&mdash;the hull seen was enacted agin, my
pardner’s anxiety and all. Only these new officials
hadn’t the sense to appreciate my nightcaps&mdash;they
turned ’em over as if they wuz common apparel.</p>

<p>Martin and Alice took everything of the sort
with composure and good nater; they wuz ust to
it, I spoze, travellin’ round all the time. And Al
Faizi looked on the faces of the men with that
searchin’, enquirin’ gaze of hisen, and didn’t say
nothin’. Adrian wuz tired, I could see, and when
we got into the carriage to take us to our hotel, he
kinder laid down in my lap and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Good, pretty little creeter!</p>

<p>San Sebastian is situated on sech a beautiful little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</span>bay that they have named it the Concha, or shell,
as we would call it. It is a noted waterin’-place, and
Queen Isabella ust to come here summers and
water herself, and bathe, and act. If I’d been here
I should have gin her a talkin’ to; I dare presoom
to say I could have got her to turn right round in
her tracts and got her to behavin’; I presoom, in
all the crowds around her, there wuzn’t one well-wisher
to walk up and tell her what wuz what.
No; praise to her face and back-bitein’ to her
back.</p>

<p>I’d ort to been there! She had a hard time all
her life, and I’m real sorry for her, and she would
have read it in my mean, and took my advice as it
wuz meant to be took.</p>

<p>Wall, we stayed here two days, and I wuz glad,
indeed, of the rest. I wuz willin’ to spend my time
with St. Sebastian, while the rest spent their time
a-meanderin’.</p>

<p>Martin and Josiah and the rest made lots of
excursions to all the castles and cathedrals in the
vicinity, but I felt middlin’ satisfied to see the most
on ’em from the outside. The ruffs of ’em, viewed
from my bedroom winder, seemed to satisfy my
mind as I looked out on ’em dreamily, as I
applied arnaky to my knee jints. I wuz real lame,
but recooperated a good deal while here.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</span></p>
<p>I did take one or two drives, when I wuz charmed
with the strange and picteresque scenery. In some
places to see the mountains a-standin’ up all round
us in the fur blue distance, and the queer little
hamlets nestled down in the deep green valleys.</p>

<p>We went to Pasages, less than a hour’s drive, to
see the very place where Lafayette sot sail to help
us git our freedom.</p>

<p>I had so many emotions here, as I viewed this
spot, that I breathed hard, and had to restrain myself
to keep a composure on the outside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</span></p>
<p>On the way back we met lots of their heavey,
rough carts, drawed by an ox and a cow lashed
together by ropes wound round their horns, and
then hitched to the cart.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp87" id="i_631" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_631.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Heavey, rough carts, drawed by an ox and a cow lashed together
by ropes wound round their horns.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As Josiah see this, he sez, “There, Samantha,
you can see the practical workin’s of wimmen’s
rights.” Sez he, “I say a cow has done all she ort
to when she’s gin a good pail of milk; she ortn’t to
plough and reap too.”</p>

<p>That speech kinder dumbfoundered me for a
spell. It wuz the smartest thing my pardner had
sed for over a year and a half. But, after considerin’
on’t for a spell, I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah, that hain’t so deep a speech as you’d
think it wuz from considerin’ it from jest on the
outside. The cases are different,” sez I. “The cow
helps draw the cart, both equal; but the cow don’t
have to pay taxes and the ox can’t make laws that
hang her and rob her, etc.”</p>

<p>But still, in my own mind, I did admire my pardner’s
observation, and admired him considerable for
thinkin’ on’t. It showed high gallantry, too, and
devotion to females; I felt quite proud on him for
pretty nigh half a day.</p>

<p>On one excursion that Martin wanted to make I
wuz more’n willin’ to accompany and go with
him&mdash;that wuz to Azpeitia, a little village 25 miles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</span>from San Sebastian; but its bein’ a mountain road,
it took us about all day to go and come.</p>

<p>But Martin didn’t begrech the time. “For,”
sez he, “I want to see the spot where the man was
born who has exerted the greatest power of any
man on earth&mdash;Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the
order of Jesuits.” Sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall be asked if I went there, and I want to
be able to say yes.”</p>

<p>How different I felt on the subject, and how different
Al Faizi felt! I see in that heathen’s rapt
eyes as we talked about it on the way the same
emotions I felt&mdash;a deep admiration for the grand,
heroic character of Loyola, a deep horrow of the
power he sot to goin’, not knowin’ how fur it wuz
a-goin’ to move, nor how much blood it wuz a-goin’
to wade through.</p>

<p>I’d hearn his history rehearsed a number of times
by Thomas Jefferson, and I knew all about it. He
wuz a favorite at court, with beauty and wit and
good sense, a brave warrior, brought down to
death’s door by the enemy’s sword. When he wuz
thirty years old, as you can see by the inscription
over his front door, “He gave himself to God.”</p>

<p>In that same hour he wuz converted, there hain’t
a doubt of that; nobody ever had more faith than
he had. Why, he see for himself the water and the
wine changed right before his eyes into the blood
and body of our Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</span></p>

<p>Some say it wuz a vision caused by his religious
ecstasy. But <i>he saw it</i>, and forevermore he
doubted not&mdash;he <i>knew</i> what he believed, and with
all the ardor of his immortal faith, with all the
brave generalship learnt by his warlike trainin’, he
led on his countless troops aginst the Wrong as he
see it.</p>

<p>Nobody can doubt the sincerity and single-mindedness
of Loyola; he give proof of it in his
life of self-denial and fastin’ and prayer. He
changed his clothes with a beggar, eat the most
loathsome food, and to mortify his pride begged
from door to door. Why, he who wuz ust to the
soft couches of a court dwelt a hull year in a cave
in plain sight of a convent built to the Virgin
Mary. He lay here on the ground a hull year,
three hundred and sixty-five nights, so that he
could show that he wuz indeed a worm of the dust
in sight of his Maker.</p>

<p>Havin’ prepared himself thus, he went to the
shrine of the Virgin Mary and spent a hull night in
prayer before the altar, then laid his sword upon
it to show that he laid aside all dreams of earthly
honor. And here he took his vows&mdash;to give his
heart’s deepest love, and his hull life’s devotion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</span></p>
<p>These vows he kep’ to the last minute of his
life. In a church built to his honor are those
words that ruled him:</p>

<p>“To the Greater Glory of God.”</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of his sincerity and no
doubt of the fatal power he wielded and wields yet.
For that strong, inexecrable hand holds empires in
its grasp, blood drippin’ through the firm, cast-iron
fingers. A well-meanin’ grasp in the first place, nobody
doubts, and as time has passed, a-snatchin’
many savages from their barbarous lives and
savage beliefs into better ways of livin’, and bringin’
’em into the shelter of the Cross.</p>

<p>Good and evil, evil and good. Loyola is not the
only Leader who has waded through seas of blood,
and all to “The Greater Glory of God.” And
what will be the end?</p>

<p>Onlimited power is a dangerous weepon to handle.
Believin’ as he did firmly, onalterably, that
his way wuz the only right way, he proceeded to
make people walk in it. He went to work jest as
the Puritans did when they hung witches and
whipped Baptists. Only as his power reached by
powerful organizations into all the countries of the
earth, so the streams of bloodshed flowed down all
the mountains of the earth, and reddened all the
valleys.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</span></p>
<p>And he, shet up to home a-fastin’ and a-prayin’
and a-seein’ visions of his Lord, and heads a-bein’
cut off and flames a-cracklin’ round the martyrs
that he caused to be put to death in the name of
his religion. And St. Francis Xavier, the best and
sweetest soul that ever lived, he too become a general
in this great army. By its swift, silent, mysterious
power Kings wuz put to death, a Pope wuz
poisoned, and some say that the Massacree of St.
Bartholomew wuz caused by it. By its power
Queen Isabella, the sweet, tender-hearted soul who
sold her own earrin’s and things to help Columbus
discover us&mdash;jest think of her, for what she wuz
made to think wuz for “The Greater Glory of
God,” she give her consent to have the dretful Inquisition
established in Spain, causin’ half a million
of Christians to be tortured and put to death.</p>

<p>Curous, hain’t it, what actin’ and behavin’ mortals
will take on themselves to do in the name of
Religion!</p>

<p>And she, so sweet, so peaceable, so holy&mdash;rejoicin’
not in Iniquity, but rejoicin’ in the Truth;
forgivin’ her enemies, blessin’ ’em that persecute
her, lovin’ all men and wimmen, blessin’ the world.</p>

<p>Queer, hain’t it!</p>

<p>Wall, from San Sebastian we went to Bruges
and put up at a hotel built in honor of a Emperor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</span>But I wuz dissapinted; a hotel in honor of a
tramp ort to have more conveniences and smell
sweeter. But I got a chance to set down and rest,
anyway, which wuz indeed a panaky to my legs and
to me.</p>

<p>I’d been quite rousted up about comin’ to
Bruges, for here Cid wuz born, as I told Josiah.</p>

<p>“Syd who?” sez he.</p>

<p>“Why, the Cid,” sez I, “who led the armies
aginst the Moors and freed Spain.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez Josiah, “I should think if he done
all that it would look better for you not to nickname
him and call him Syd. You never wuz intimate
with Sydney,” sez he.</p>

<p>Sez I, “That hain’t his name; it is C-i-d, Cid.
Hain’t you hearn Thomas J. read about him&mdash;all
the great things he did, and how after he wuz dead
he rode into Bruges clad in armor? And when a
Jew approached his dead body to offer it some insult
his mailed hand come up and knocked him
down.”</p>

<p>Sez Josiah, “I don’t approve of Syds doin’ that
anyway&mdash;I should go aginst it; it would be apt to
make queer funerals if sech things wuz encouraged.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “I don’t say it is so, but I’ve
hearn tell it wuz.”</p>

<p>Anyway, we found in the town-hall his bones wuz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</span>nothin’ but dust. Josiah kinder sheered away from
the box where they wuz kep’, but nothin’ took place
and ensued.</p>

<p>The cathedral is a sight&mdash;a sight. I felt a good
deal as I stood under its walls as a ant would feel
if she wuz sot down under Bunker Hill Monument.
And inside the buildin’ my emotions wuz still more
various and lofty. The interior is exquisite, grand
beyend any idee almost, and the proportions are so
perfect, the harmony of it affects one a good deal as
the most melogious music would, and the colorin’ is
jest as perfect as the architecture. Take it all in all,
it is a sight&mdash;a sight. Even Josiah wuz affected by
it; his local pride wuz lowered imperceptibly, and
sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ve cracked up the Jonesville meetin’-house
everywhere I’ve been, and it is a comogious structure,
but this goes ahead on’t, and I will own up
that it duz.”</p>

<p>Martin sed, “I’m glad I’ve been here; a good
many of my friends have spoken of it to me. I shall
be glad to say that I have studied this much-talked-of
cathedral at length.”</p>

<p>We wuz there about half a hour.</p>

<p>Al Faizi showed in his ardent face, lifted in reverence
and admirin’ or, jest how he felt about it.
The lights from the stained-glass winder gleamed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</span>on’t, and made it look almost inspired. He nor I
didn’t seem to want to talk much about it. I never
do when I see Niagara. No, I’m willin’ to let that
do the talkin’ to my rapt soul.</p>

<p>It wuz so here. When I stood in these cathedrals,
the grandeur and might of their silent oratory
preached to me so loud that I wuz almost overwhelmed
and by the side of myself, and carried some
distance by the power of the sperit that carried out
these grand results.</p>

<p>But anon, when I got outside, other emotions
got into my sperit; they come in onbid, and I had
to use ’em well.</p>

<p>I thought how on great days the congregation
who meet here would worship God all day and
wave banners and anon fire cannons in honor of
some saint or other, and then end up with a bull-fight.</p>

<p>Jest as if Josiah and Deacon Bobbett should pass
the Holy Communion, bread and wine, and then
withdraw into the horse-shed, and have a dog or
rooster fight.</p>

<p>It took off a number of my soarin’ emotions to
think on’t, probble as many as 80 or 85. I had
had over a hundred right along&mdash;I know I had.</p>

<p class="h2sub">JOSIAH’S DEVOTION.</p>

<p>Wall, another day we went to see the Carthusian
Monastery, founded four hundred years ago by
Queen Isabella&mdash;Christopher Columbuses Isabella&mdash;the
intimate friend of America (owin’ to jewelry,
discovery, etc.).</p>

<p>Josiah and I thought we would branch out this
day and go alone, so he secured the gayest-lookin’
rig he could find, drawed by three mules hitched
side by side. It attracted all the beggars in town,
so they follered us as a dog with a bone is follered
by other dogs.</p>

<p>But Josiah took it as a tribute to our style, and
he leaned back in perfect delight, and sez he, a-wavin’
his hand with a kind of hauty wave&mdash;</p>

<p>“Drive by Alameda!”</p>

<p>Come to find out the reasons he gin his orders
wuz he’d heard Alameda talked about, and he
thought she wuz a woman, and mebby a American,
and he wanted to show off before her.</p>

<p>But it wuzn’t a woman. It wuz a pretty park,
and we driv along and crost the river, and went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</span>
through a long avenue of ellum trees each side on’t,
and anon we found ourselves on top of a noble hill
in front of a Monastery.</p>

<p>Here we rung the bell at a gate for admission,
and a small grated winder wuz opened and a man’s
face appeared with a dark-colored nightcap on.</p>

<p>He asked if there wuz wimmen in the party. If
there wuz we couldn’t come in.</p>

<p>I guess he wuz fraxious, bein’ waked up sudden.
I jedged from his nightcap. But little did I think
it would have sech a effect on my pardner.</p>

<p>He could not at first comprehend the indignity
offered to his beloved pardner. But the driver repeated
it; sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Friar says you can come in, but no woman
could be admitted.”</p>

<p>Then I see the power of cast-iron devotion made
harder by the hammers of Joy and Sorrer a-hammerin’
down on the anvil of Time. That noble but
too hasty man riz right up in the vehicle and shook
his fist at the man with the nightcap, and hollered
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ll give that fryer a piece of my mind!” and
before I interfered he yelled out:</p>

<p>“You may keep right on with your fryin’; I
won’t stir a step inside if Samantha can’t come too.
I’ll let you know that any place that’s too good for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]
</span>her is too good for me. Keep right on with your
fryin’, your bull beef will probble spile if it hain’t
cooked!”</p>

<p>I ketched him by his vest, and sez I: “Pause,
Josiah Allen. He hain’t a cook; it is a F-r-i-a-r.”</p>

<p>“How do you spoze I care how you spell it?
You can spell their bull-fights b-o-u-l if you want
to; that don’t hender ’em from havin’ to take care
of their fresh beef. Keep right on a-fryin’!” sez he
in bitter mockery. “My Samantha hain’t probble
good enough to see a little beef a-fryin’; but,” sez
he, waxin’ eloquent, as, animated by the power of
love, he stood up nobly for me&mdash;</p>

<p>“You can fry all day and think you go ahead of
any woman, and be too proud to let ’em see you at
it; but Samantha’s cookin’ is as fur ahead of yours
as the United States is bigger than Spain. And
I’d ruther have one of Samantha’s steaks that she
cooks than all the beef that you ever killed at your
dum bull-fights. And don’t you forgit it!” he hollered,
as the driver drove away by my almost
frenzied directions.</p>

<p>He sunk back exhausted on his seat as we swep’
on. And you can jedge of his agitation when I
say that he threw out three copper cents all to
one time to the swarm of ragged beggars that run
along by the side of the carriage. He threw ’em
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</span>out mekanically, and as if he didn’t know what
he wuz about. Ah! the insult to me rankled deep
in his noble but small-sized frame. He didn’t git
over it all that night. I always knew he loved me
deeply&mdash;I knew it in Jonesville, and I knew it in
Spain. But oh! how touchin’ the proof wuz that
he gin to me as his voice rung out in the vast,
lonesome bareness of our chamber in Bruges,
Spain, as he lifted his hand in mockery, and cried
out:</p>

<p>“Keep right on with your fryin’; you won’t git
me to eat a mou’ful while Samantha is hungry!”</p>

<p>Oh, the power of love! How it gilds with its
rosy rays the quiet ways of Jonesville! How it
still shone on and shed its ambient light in a
foreign land! But I gently hunched him and
woke him up, for I see it wuz endin’ in nightmair.</p>

<p>I wuz too overcome by a deep sense of his nobility
of sentiment in my behaff to argy with
him that day. I felt that it would be ongrateful
in me; and then, agin, I felt that he wuz too overcome
by the greatness of his emotions&mdash;I knew
his frame wuz but small, and his devoted affection
and his righteous anger mighty. I dassent add
another single emotion to them he wuz already
a-carryin’&mdash;no, I dassent venter. But I talked
soothin’ly all the evenin’, and said not a upbraidin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</span>
word when his nightmair snorted and waked
me up with its prancin’ huffs.</p>

<p>No; I, too, am a devoted pardner, and know
when to talk and when to keep silence. That is
a great nack for pardners to learn&mdash;one of the
greatest and most neccessary.</p>

<p>But the next mornin’, when all wuz calm, and
a not knowin’ how fur his emotions might lead
him agin into twittin’ them Spaniards about their
national custom of bull-fights, etc., and fearin’ he
might git into serous trouble by it when I wuz
not near to soothe and assuage the ragin’ tumult, I
sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah, you made a mistake yesterday; that
man in the nightcap wuzn’t a-fryin’ the beef slaughtered
in their bull-fights. They don’t eat that;
why,” sez I, “sech mad beef wouldn’t be fit to eat&mdash;it
would make ’em sick.”</p>

<p>“Wall, don’t they look sick?” sez he; “a little,
under-sized, saller set, caused almost entirely,” sez
he, “by eatin’ that beef.”</p>

<p>Wall, I see that I couldn’t change his mind, and
I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall, anyway, they’re about the politest creeters
I ever see, and how soft and melogious their voices
are! Their words seem as soft as velvet and silk.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he; “if they wuz a-goin’ to spell ‘cat’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</span>
or ‘dog,’ they would pronounce it c-a-t, cattah, or
d-o-g, doggah,” sez he. “I’m kinder sick on’t,
but most probble they can’t help it&mdash;it is caused
by their diet; and,” sez he, lookin’ wise&mdash;</p>

<p>“That bull beef hain’t the worst on’t. Don’t
history tell of that Diet of Worms that they wanted
Martin Luther to partake on and he wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Josiah, that wuz the name of the meetin’
he wuz dragged before.”</p>

<p>Sez he, “I take history or the Bible as it reads,
and I know I have read a sight of that Diet they
couldn’t git Martin to jine in with ’em and partake of.”</p>

<p>Mekanically I disputed him, for my thoughts
wuzn’t there. No, as I thought on’t, the form of
my companion a-tyin’ his necktie before the small
lookin’-glass, and a-tryin’ to edify me, faded away,
and I seemed to look back through the centuries
and see that brave Monk a-standin’ up for the Holy
Truth, revealed to him in his cloister, as it has been
through all time revealed to chosen, prophetic souls.
I seemed to see the angry-faced assemblage surroundin’
him. The cold, gloomy face of Charles
V., King of Spain and Emperor of Germany,
a-lookin’ frownin’ly on him as he pleaded for liberty
and conscience. And I seemed to hear Luther’s
voice say the words that have echoed down through
all these centuries and are a-echoin’ still:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</span></p>
<p>“Here I take my stand, I cannot do otherwise.
God help me!”</p>

<p>But anon the voice of my pardner drawed me
back down the long aisle of the years wet with
blood, black with the Inquisition, with little oases
of Peace scattered along, shinin’ through the lurid
battle clouds.</p>

<p>His voice rousted me as it sed, “Hain’t you
never goin’ to git that nightcap off, Samantha?
I’m almost starved to death, though what I’m goin’
to eat, goodness knows.”</p>

<p>And as I hastily took off my nightcap and
wadded up my back hair, he resoomed&mdash;</p>

<p>“I never wuz any case to eat clear pepper and
ginger for any length of time, or allspice.” Sez he,
“I am slowly wastin’ away, Samantha; I’ll bet I
weigh five or six ounces less than I did when I left
home.” Sez he, pitifully, “It seems to me, Samantha,
if I could set down once more quiet in our
own home and eat one of your good breakfusts, I
would be willin’ to die.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” sez I, “less try to bear up and lot on
gittin’ back home agin.” Sez I, “One of the
noblest fruits of travel, Josiah, is the longin’ it gives
us to be back home agin and settle down and rest.”</p>

<p>He assented with a deep sithe, and at my request
hooked up my dress skirt in the back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</span></p>

<div class="figright illowp71" id="i_647" style="max-width: 15em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>At my request he hooked up my dress skirt in the
back.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wall, knowin’ Martin’s pecular, but, as I found
out afterwards, popular idees of travel, I didn’t expect
to remain long in Spain; but we did stay there
several days, for, as Martin sed, after comin’ so fur
he wanted to make a
exhaustive study of the
country; so we stayed
most a week.</p>

<p>Wall, so far as exhaustion
wuz concerned
I felt that we wuz havin’
a success, for I wuz
as tired as a dog from
day to day, and tireder
than any dogs I ever
see from all appearance.</p>

<p>But Martin sed that
we would visit Madrid
before we left the country,
for he sed that he
wouldn’t want to be
asked if he had been to the capital of Spain
and be obliged to say no. Al Faizi spoke of
wantin’ to see the Alhambra, and I myself, havin’
been introduced to it by Washington Irving and
my boy, had a sort of a longin’ to explore its
wonders. But Martin sed that he had studied the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</span>Alhambra exhaustively at Chicago, and he felt,
seein’ he had got all the information that could be
got on the subject, it wuz useless to prolong our
trip by goin’ there.</p>

<p>Sez he, “If there was anything new to learn I
would go, for it is my way to go to the very
bottom of things in exploration or discovery; but,”
sez he, “I spent over half an hour in the Alhambra
in Chicago, and I have no more to learn.”</p>

<p>I had been in that place myself, and had got lost,
and felt like a fool there. I remembered well how
I roamed through them curous labrinths, and had
been brought up standin’ in front of myself repeatedly,
and had bowed to myself real polite, thinkin’
that I recognized some familar form from Jonesville.</p>

<p>And there it wuz myself, in one of them countless
lookin’-glasses. I felt cheaper than dirt.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would think it wuz two or three
somebody elses, and I’d wonder how so many other
wimmen could look so much like me as these
several ones did, a-appearin’ right up in front and
on both sides of me.</p>

<p>Only I would always give up every time that
there didn’t none on ’em look nigh so well as I did.
They didn’t somehow have sech a noble look to
’em, and their clothes didn’t hang so well as mine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</span>did, and their bunnet strings wuz more rumpled up,
and their front hair wuzn’t so smooth, and they
looked fur more tired out than I ever looked, and
bewildered like, and kinder wan.</p>

<p>Yes, I’d been through them labrinths. I had
enough of Moorish palaces by the time I got out,
a plenty.</p>

<p>And if, as Martin sed, there wuz nothin’ more to
see in Grenada, I didn’t care a cent to go. And I
thought more’n as like as not I should lose Josiah
in a labrinth&mdash;lose him for good and all.</p>

<p>So I gin a willin’ consent to proceed onwards to
Madrid. The children wuz willin’ to go anywhere,
and so wuz Al Faizi, for, as he sed to me:</p>

<p>“Truth makes her home in all lands. I seek
the light of her face under every sky.”</p>

<p>And, poor creeter! not findin’ it time and agin,
I’m afraid. Though in our long talks about this
country, which in tryin’ to stomp out Protestantism,
had stomped out her own life; and in tryin’ to
drownd out Religion in the blood of her saints,
had drownded out her own civilization and progress&mdash;</p>

<p>Al Faizi and I talked this all over, but took comfort
in thinkin’, after all, that good can be found in
every country by them that seek her benine face.
We took sights of comfort in talkin’ back and forth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</span>about the Archbishop of Grenada, and his self-sacrificin’,
heroic doin’s in the great cholera plague
of 1885.</p>

<p>No Methodist could have done any better than
he did, no deacon or minister or anybody. I d’no
as John Wesley could have come up to it.</p>

<p>Wall, as I sed, I felt well to think that we had
saved a journey to Grenada, though I had kinder
lotted on walkin’ under the Gate of Jestice that I
knew had to be gone through to visit the Alhambra.
But I sort o’ comforted myself by the thought
that mebby it wuz only a name, after all.</p>

<p>I got real soothed for my dissapintment in not
walkin’ through it by thinkin’ of our own Halls of
Jestice, and a-meditatin’ that Jestice never sot her
foot in ’em from one year’s end to the other, as nigh
as I could find out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE QUEEN, ULALEY, AND A BULL-FIGHT.</p>

<p>Wall, we had a very fatiguin’ journey, durin’
which I will pass over the sufferin’s of my pardner
from the hot, dry climate, the ever-present pangs of
hunger, that wuz always with him, and the fraxiousness,
that, alas! always overcomes him at sech tuckerin’
times.</p>

<p>I will draw a curtain of cretonne over the incidents
of our tegus, tegus journey, and only draw it
back agin, on its hot, dry, brass rings, when we are
once more settled down in a middlin’ good tarvern
at Madrid&mdash;I a-settin’ by the winder and Josiah
a-layin’ on the bed fast asleep, the dressin’-gown
folded lovin’ly round his small-boneded figger.</p>

<p>Martin and the children and Al Faizi went out a
good deal to see all the strange, new sights of the
Spanish capitol.</p>

<p>But I took considerable comfort a-settin’ still in
as comfortable a chair as I could find, a-lookin’ down
on the Spaniards and their kinder queer-lookin’
housen, and the strange costooms and ways of
another country&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</span></p>
<p>The tall, hauty-lookin’ Dons a-walkin’ along as if
the ground wuzn’t quite good enough for ’em to walk
on, and the dark-eyed wimmen, and the children, and
the beggars, and the splendid carriages, some on
’em drawed by six horses apiece, and their harnesses
all glitterin’ with gold, and the humbler vehicles
drawed by mules, and these mules trimmed off beautiful,
too, and, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz on the third day after we arrov in
Madrid, and I wuz a-walkin’ in the Public Garden
with little Adrian and my Josiah, when, on turnin’
the corner of a leafy avenue, who should I see, right
face to face a-comin’ towards me, but my intimate
friend, Ulaley.</p>

<p>I wuz tickled most to death. It is always happifyin’
in a strange and foreign country to meet anybody
you’re intimate with, and when that friend is
a Infanty, and one you’ve advised and neighbored
with, your happiness is still greater.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>She knowed me to once&mdash;a happy smile curved her
pretty lips.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I advanced and held out my hand, my Josiah and
Adrian a-bringin’ up my rear. She knowed me to
once&mdash;a happy smile curved her pretty lips, and sez
she&mdash;</p>

<p>“Madam, I’m pleased to meet you. I remember
seein’ you in your own country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “we met in Chicago, Ill., and had
a first-rate visit there.” Sez I, “How have you
been ever sence I see you, and how is all your folks?
How is Antonio?” Sez I, “Did he git through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</span>
winter all right? Sickness and the grip has been
round lots, and if it has spared our two pardners
we ort to be thankful.
And that makes me
think,” sez I, “let me introduce
my pardner, Josiah
Allen.</p>

<p>“Josiah,” sez I, “this
is the Infanty&mdash;Ulaley,
you’ve hearn me speak
on.”</p>

<p>Josiah made his best
and lowest bow, and
murmured sunthin’ about
havin’ read about her in
the <i>World</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “and
you’ve hearn me talk
about her a sight.”</p>

<p>But he had a sort of a obstinate streak come over
him, sech as pardners will have in the strangest and
most onconvenient times, and he never assented to
that at all, but sed agin that he had read about her
in the <i>World</i>.</p>

<p>And I had to let it go. Truly, pardners, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</span>agreeable at times, yet how clost do they clip off the
wings of your pride and ambition at other and more
various times!</p>

<p>Ulaley see it. Wimmen know only too well
how often sech <i>contrarytemps</i> occurs, and she
helped me out, as I’ve helped many a woman out
of the mud-puddle of embarrassment a pardner’s
words have throwed her into.</p>

<p>Sez she, “I have such warm recollections of your
country&mdash;it is so great a country,” sez she.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “our country is a middlin’ big one,
but I thought I wouldn’t speak of the size on’t to
you, Ulaley, thinkin’ that you might think mebby
that I’d come over here to kinder twit you of the
smallness of yourn.” And wantin’ to be real polite,
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>“The value of anything don’t always depend on
its size.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” sez Josiah.</p>

<p>He wuz alludin’ to his own small weight by the
steelyards. But I waved off his speech&mdash;I felt
quite cool towards him, about as cool as rain-water,
and I wouldn’t fall in with his hint and gin him my
usual compliment.</p>

<p>Wall, jest as the Infanty and I wuz a-talkin’ back
and forth, a woman and a little boy, who had been
a-lingerin’ a little behind, come up, and I see in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</span>minute who they wuz; and though I’m bashful by
nater&mdash;very, yet knowin’ that I had the honor and
politeness of my own country and Jonesville to uphold,
I advanced towards her in a very admirin’,
respectful way.</p>

<p>Yes, I see it wuz the Queen Regent and little
Alfonso himself. I wuz tickled, and still hampered,
by the duties that devolved onto me, but above all
of my emotions riz the thought of how glad I wuz
to meet ’em, and how glad they would be afterwards
a-thinkin’ it over to think that they had a chance to
meet me.</p>

<p>Ulaley didn’t make no move to introduce us.
And I see in a minute how it wuz. There wuz the
Queen pardnerless and alone, there wuz I with my
livin’ pardner; it would roust up too many sad
memories to bring us all closter to each other.</p>

<p>But she’d no need to hesitated on that account; I
could have told the Queen that though a pardnerless
state had its trials, havin’ a pardner brings afflictions
also&mdash;Heaven knows it duz!</p>

<p>But I see how it wuz, and havin’ the sole glory
of Jonesville and America in my eyes, I advanced
forwards with quite a lot of dignity and made a
deep curchy.</p>

<p>I took holt of each side of my brown alpaca dress
and held out the skirt a very little. They wuz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</span>
good curchys, and I made about three on ’em&mdash;two
to the Queen Regent and one to Alfonso. I
thought one wuz about right for him, considerin’
his age.</p>

<p>I then advanced and held out my hand, and sez
I&mdash;“I am glad to meet you, Julia, and tell you how
well I think on you.” Sez I, “A young woman who
has done as well as you have with what you have
had to do with deserves to be encouraged, and I’m
glad to encourage you.”</p>

<p>She looked awful surprised at my good manners
and politeness; she bowed her head in almost dumbfounder,
as I could see, and I went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ve had a hard time on’t, Julia&mdash;real hard.
It’s always hard to leave your own folks when
you’re married and go and live with his folks, and I
presoom you’ve had days when you thought his
folks didn’t treat you well&mdash;it is nateral. And I
presoom he cut up more or less&mdash;pardners will.
And you, fur away from your own folks, made
the cuttin’ up and actin’ seem worse. I persoom
you’ve had days when you would have willin’ly
swapped off five or six Spanish palaces for one free,
onfettered hour beyend the Alps. And you would
have willin’ly swapped the most flatterin’ words
addressed to you in a strange tongue to listen to
the swashin’ waves of the blue Danube, the ripplin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</span>
waves that beat up agin the shores of home&mdash;you
had a real hard time.</p>

<p>“And then, to cap all, your pardner wuz took
from you, before even the catnip wuz put to steepin’&mdash;before
his baby’s eyes could look any comfort
into yours. Poor creeter! what a hard time on’t
you did have.</p>

<p>“But when the baby wuz born, he brung a new
life to you&mdash;you see your dead-and-gone pardner’s
first tender love a-shinin’ through the little face, all
the passion and dross and dissapintment of a pardner’s
love filtered through the divine and satisfyin’
sweetness of a child’s love.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has made life and Spain different things
to you, and you’ve sprunted up and done well&mdash;you’ve
done first rate! You are a-bringin’ up little
Alfonso jest as well as I could, and I d’no but
better, for, bein’ younger, you can git round
spryer and find out new things to teach him. His
little hands, too, have drawed you and Spain nigher
to each other; you think as much agin of each
other as you ust to, and I’m glad on’t.</p>

<p>“And how do you do?” sez I, a-holdin’ out my
hand to little Alfonso.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Are you pretty well, Bub?”</p>

<p>He answered real pretty, and I then and there
introduced little Adrian to him, and I sez&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</span></p>
<p>“I wish I had both of you children to Jonesville
for a month in strawberry time or blackberry time&mdash;it
would do you both lots of good.” And I sez
to his ma&mdash;</p>

<p>“It seems to me he looks ruther pimpin’; have
you gin him any smartweed lately?” Sez I, “A
syrup of smartweed and catnip, half and half,
sweetened with honey, would set him right up agin,
and if you’d like to try it, I will write and have
Philury send you over a bundle of the herbs.”</p>

<p>She hesitated&mdash;I see she felt a delicacy about
makin’ me so much trouble.</p>

<p>But I sez, “It won’t be no trouble at all&mdash;we’ve
got more’n a floursack full up in the woodhouse
chamber.”</p>

<p>She didn’t reply, but still looked sort o’ wonderin’
and queer.</p>

<p>And I sez&mdash;“I will write to-day to Philury to
send you a paper bag full of the herbs, and a handful
of spignut&mdash;that is dretful good for a cold, if he
happens to git one, and boys will, goin’ barefooted
and actin’.” Sez I, “Pour bilein’ water on ’em, and
let ’em stand, and be sure the water biles.”</p>

<p>But at this minute their carriage driv up&mdash;they’d
been a-walkin’ for exercise, I guess. And though
I presoom they hated to leave me&mdash;hated to like
dogs, they had to tear themselves away.</p>

<p>But they bowed real polite to me, and Ulaley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</span>
held out her hand and shook hands. The Queen
wuz busy with the little boy, but they both bowed
real polite after they got into the carriage. And
then they driv off.</p>

<p>The carriage wuzn’t nigh so showy as some we
see, and the Queen Regent wuz dressed real plain.</p>

<p>I believe she’s a real likely woman, and if anything
happens to her, and she should lose her property,
I’d love to have her come and settle down in
Jonesville&mdash;I’d love to neighbor with her first rate.</p>

<p>But I truly hope she won’t never have to make
the move&mdash;I hope the little King will have his Pa’s
good nater, and his Ma’s good sense and Christian
sperit, and that Spain and he won’t have no fallin’
out, but do well by each other.</p>

<p>Wall, Martin and Alice went to a bull-fight. I
waved off coldly Martin’s request to accompany and
go with ’em, though Josiah wuz, for a minute,
rampant to go.</p>

<p>But I didn’t encourage him in it.</p>

<p>He sez it would be sunthin’ to talk over with Ury
and Deacon Bobbett when I got home.</p>

<p>This wuz his best argument, and I sez, “If I
couldn’t talk over anything but this I wouldn’t
talk at all. The idee,” sez I, “of human bein’s
with hearts in their bosoms a-settin’ to see a wild
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</span>animal kill a human bein’, and visey versey.” Sez
I, “If I should see it goin’ on I should be so
shamed on’t that I shouldn’t want to speak agin at
all for some time.”</p>

<p>But sez Josiah, “It’s a national recreation; it’s
fascinatin’; probble you’d like it.”</p>

<p>“Mebby,” sez I; “mebby my heart would git so
hard that I could enjoy it&mdash;I, that in days of pig
and beef killin’ have always run into the parlor bedroom
and put my fingers in my ears to escape the
sounds of agony the poor brutes make.” Sez I,
“Spozen if in them days I should invite the minister
and his folks and the Jonesvillians, and have high
seats built up aginst the side of the barn, and let
’em witness the gory spectacle?”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>The Matador.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Josiah sot a minute in deep thought. “Wall,”
sez he, “I’ll be hanged if it wouldn’t be stylish.
You could drape some turkey-red calico over the
top, kinder canopy style, and I and Ury could dress
like them Spanish Matadors with knee-breeches and
a long sash, and some feathers in our hats.”</p>

<p>Sez he, growin’ enthused with the new idee,
“We could use our winter scarfs&mdash;they’re very gay
colored; and I could take that long feather out of
your winter bunnet, and have it hang down gracefully
over my left shoulder, and I guess Tirzah Ann
would lend me a couple to stand up in front. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</span>
declare, it would be sunthin’ new and uneek, and
we’ll have it next fall.”</p>

<p>I glared at him with a stuny look, and sez I&mdash;“And
while you’re all dressed up and
enjoyin’ yourself, what of the poor dumb
brutes who are made to suffer the agony
of death?” Sez I, “What happiness
could come to you built up on a custom
of pain and sufferin’, bloodshed
and terrer? Let me hear no more
about sech a seen.”</p>

<p>“But,” sez he, “it would make
talk; it would be the topic in all
the genteel circles of Jonesville and
Loontown.”</p>

<p>“If you should brain me with a
tommyhawk it would make talk,”
sez I.</p>

<p>“The idee of your follerin’ sech a
custom as this. I scorn and despise sech doin’s,
and I don’t see what a nation can be thinkin’ on
to allow it to go on.”</p>

<p>Al Faizi writ down quite a
lot in that book of hisen about
the bull-fightin’, and he seemed
to be lookin’ for a peticular page
to jot down his notes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</span></p>
<p>And Josiah sez (he hain’t no scruples about
questionin’ the noble heathen), sez he, “What are
you lookin’ for, Fazer?”</p>

<p>He sez calmly, “I am looking for the page
where I wrote down the doings of John Sullivan
and other American prize-fighters. I wish to put
public exhibitions of this nature together.”</p>

<p>His tone wuz as calm and serene as a cool afternoon
in June. He hadn’t a shade of sarcasm or
irony in his axent; no, he simply grouped similar
occurrences together.</p>

<p>And where wuz my feathers that had stood up
hautily on my foretop as I condemned another
country’s doin’s and cuttin’s up? Where wuz
they? They wuz droopin’ and hangin’ down limp
on my foretop as I sot and meditated how we in
America allowed prize-fighters to knock and
bruise and maim each other in public for the delight
of the throngin’ multitude. Then fill hull
sides of our American newspapers with minute details
of their punchin’ and knockin’ down and actin’,
for the eyes of our youth to peruse and emulate.
Deeds of religion and science and philanthropy all
pushed into the background, amongst the advertisements,
while the papers were flooded with the
deeds of men fighters and men killers.</p>

<p>The idee! What wuz I, to talk about the doin’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</span>of Spain or the doin’s of a Josiah, and look down
on ’em? Truly, folks who live in glass housen
mustn’t throw stuns; how many, many times I
realized this deep truth when I witnessed doin’s I
didn’t like in foreign countries!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">A SPANISH FUNERAL AND A JONESVILLE ONE.</p>

<p>While we wuz in Madrid we felt that we ort to
anyway visit the Escuriel, that immense palace and
monastery built by Philip II. He got skairt,
so I wuz told, and made a vow to St. Lawrence (it
wuz on that saint’s day) that if Lawrence would
help him git the victory, he would build a monastery
and name it after him. So havin’ won the
victory, he did as he agreed. He built this immense
structure; it took him twenty-one years to
do it. Out of compliment to Lawrence, who perished
on a gridiron, it wuz built in that form.</p>

<p>I hearn Josiah a-explainin’ it that day. Sez he,
“It wuz built in the form of a gridiron because
that is the best way of cookin’ beef.” Sez he,
“After their bull-fights they have immense quantities
of beef, so this takes its shape from that
national characterestick.”</p>

<p>But it hain’t no sech thing&mdash;he gits things wrong.</p>

<p>Wall, it wouldn’t took us but a little while to git
to the Escuriel if the train had sprunted up and
gone as fast as an American hand-car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</span></p>
<p>But we crept along so slow that it took us three
hours. Before we got there we see the buildin’
loomin’ up so vast, so gloomy, that it looked like a
mountain itself&mdash;a low, big mountain without much
of a peak to it.</p>

<p>We had to approach it with some dignity, it
bein’ a royal palace, so we got into a big covered
omnibus, drawed by four mules and two horses.
Though what peticular dignity there is in a mule
I never see before, unless it is in their ears. But we
got there all right, the driver a-yellin’ and whippin’
the mules as if he wuz crazy. If you want beauty,
you won’t git it in the Escuriel, but if you want
size, there you are suited. It takes up as much
room as one of the pyramids; it has two thousand
rooms in it and five thousand winders, and the winders
wuzn’t very thick together, neither.</p>

<p>There is a big meetin’-house in it, a palace and a
monastery and a Pantheon, where the dead kings
and mothers of kings sleep and forgit the troublesome
days when they sot on thrones, and worried
about their children who wuz settin’.</p>

<p>This meetin’-house is grand and imposin’; you
can look down inside a long, clear space of four
hundred feet. Then there is a library, one of the
finest in Spain, and picters that are dretful impressive
in number and beauty. We wanted to see the
private room of Philip II., and so we wuz led up
grand staircases and through apartment after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</span> apartment
hung with the costliest tapestry.</p>

<p>And havin’ seen sech glory on the outside, what
did we imagine must be the splendor of the inner
room, sacred to his majesty, where he sat alone
and sent out orders that ruled half
or three quarters of the world.</p>

<p>Wall, I d’no as you’ll believe me
when I say the floor wuz brick&mdash;not
even a strip of rag carpet on’t, sech
as I spread down often in my back
kitchen.</p>

<p>Poor creeter! I’d gin him a
breadth of my best hit-or-miss carpet
in welcome if I’d lived in his day,
and known how cold his feet must
have been as he stepped out of bed
cold mornin’s onto that hard brick
floor.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp57" id="i_666" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_666.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>How cold his feet must have been
cold mornin’s.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And there wuzn’t a picter on the walls&mdash;not
one, only a picter of the Virgin.</p>

<p>I’d a-gin him one of my chromos in welcome. I
had two throwed in at Jonesville with the last
chocolate calico dress I bought.</p>

<p>He should have had one on ’em, and I’d a-gin
’em both to him if it would a-made that gloomy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</span>
mysterious creeter any happier; and most probble
they would have had their influence&mdash;they wuz
very bright colored.</p>

<p>One hard wood chair and two stools wuz the
only settin’ accommodations he had. I’d made him
a barrell chair, if I’d been there; if he’d wanted to go
in for cheapness, that would have suited him. Saw
a seat out of an old salt barrell and cushion it with
a old bed-quilt and cover it with cretonne.</p>

<p>He could a-sot easy in it. Poor creeter! it
made me feel bad to think he always sot on that
hard board chair&mdash;not a sign of a cushion in it.
I could have made a good cushion for it anyway
out of hens’ feathers. And mebby he wouldn’t
been so hard on the nations if he’d sot easier&mdash;it
makes a sight of difference. Josiah wuz as hard
agin on Ury when he had a bile on his back,
and couldn’t set easy. I didn’t know but Ury
would leave.</p>

<p>Wall, Philip lived here fourteen years, and
when he come to die, he died hard, so they
say. Mebby the oceans of blood he had caused
to be shed kinder swashed up aginst his conscience;
if it did, I hope the prayers he had knelt
on the hard floor and prayed all night long sort o’
lifted him up some.</p>

<p>Queer creeter! strange and mysterious doin’s! <span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</span>
A-prayin’ and a-fastin’ and a-killin’, a-prayin’ and
a-killin’ and a-fastin’! I am glad I hain’t got to
straighten out the dark and tangled skein of his
life and git the threads a-runnin’ even, and sort out
the black threads and the lighter ones and count
’em.</p>

<p>No, it takes a bigger hand than mine to hold
’em, and a eye that looks deeper into the soul of
things.</p>

<p>Wall, when he wuz dead at last they laid him in
the Pantheon. We visited the spot. We went
down first into the big, eight-sided room, a sort of
annex, where princes and princesses lay, and then
we went down a long flight of steps with walls of
jasper, into the room where kings and queens lay
asleep.</p>

<p>This is a smaller room, but eight-sided, like the
other. The dead lay in black marble coffins, piled
up on top of the other, the kings to the right, the
queens to the left. Wimmen have to take the
second-best place even down there in the grave,
but then they wuz in a condition where they
couldn’t argy about it, and where it wouldn’t hurt
their feelin’s.</p>

<p>It must have been a sight to see a king buried.
No funeral in Jonesville ever approached it in
solemnity or mystery.</p>

<p>You know they don’t give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</span> up that a king is
dead till they go through with certain performances,
but they treat the dead body with all the honor that
they would give the livin’ monarch. When the
procession gits up to the door, the new-comer has
to be announced.</p>

<p>A voice sez, “Who would enter here?”</p>

<p>They reply, “King Philip.”</p>

<p>Then the door is thrown open, and all the long,
illustrious procession of the noblest in the land enter,
and they lay the body of the king on a table,
for he has got to give his own consent, as it were,
before they will admit that he is dead&mdash;silence gives
consent, they say.</p>

<p>So after all are gone the Lord Chamberlain lifts
the heavey, gold-embroidered pall, and kneelin’
down by the side of his royal master, looks long in
his face to see if he recognizes him. But he don’t.
He lays cold and still as marble.</p>

<p>Then he cries, “Señor! Señor! Señor!” and
waits for a reply. But as no answer comes, he sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“His Majesty does not answer! then indeed the
king is dead!”</p>

<p>So he takes the wand of office&mdash;the septer, I
spoze&mdash;and breaks it over the coffin in token of a
power that has ceased to be. Then he locks the
marble coffin, hands the key to the Prior of the
Monastery, and they go up the long steps and leave
the king to sleep with his own folks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</span></p>

<p>It must have been a sight to see it go on.</p>

<p>Why, a mourner who undertook sech doin’s in
Jonesville or Loontown would find himself lugged
off to the loonatick asylum, or have threats on’t.
But the ways of countries differ&mdash;I didn’t make any
moves to break it up. I am very liberal minded,
and then I meditated that it wuzn’t my funeral.</p>

<p>What made me say that a mourner in Jonesville
couldn’t do sech a thing wuz owin’ to a incident
that came under my own observation.</p>

<p>A man that lived in the outskirts of Jonesville,
havin’ moved down there from Zoar, got it into his
head that he wuz goin’ to die on a certain day at
two o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>So what should that creeter do but write his own
funeral sermon, and gin out the word that he would
preach it at one o’clock sharp. Because he wuz to
die at two precisely.</p>

<p>He got his coffin made, his wife got her mournin’
clothes all done, for he wuz so dead sure of the result
that he had converted her to his belief. So at
one o’clock exactly the crowd gathered to see the
corpse, as you may say, preach its own funeral
sermon.</p>

<p>The coffin wuz in the parlor, the mourners come
down from upstairs, some on ’em weepin’ bitterly,
and headed by the body, dressed in its shroud, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</span>bearin’
its own funeral sermon.</p>

<p>The mourners wuz arranged in orderly rows round
the room (he wuz wide connected), and the body
stood by the head of the coffin and preached a long
sermon.</p>

<p>He touched on the sins of his hearers, and of
course they couldn’t resent it in him, bein’ a corpse’s
last thoughts, as you may say.</p>

<p>He bore down hard on ’em, specially his relations&mdash;the
more distant ones, cousins and sech,
and kinder rubbed up his bretheren and sistern
some.</p>

<p>But to his wife he spoke words of tenderness, and
in a touchin’ and fervent manner spoke of what she
had lost. He praised himself up to the highest
notch, and his wife sobbed out loud, and she had to
be fanned on both sides by a circuit minister and
his wife, who wuz present; and she sed to ’em that
she had never mistrusted before what a prize she
had in her pardner.</p>

<p>He then warned his children to grow up as nigh
like their father as they could conveniently, and he
got ’em to sniffin’ and wipin’ their noses. He then
addressed the community, tellin’ ’em of their sinful
ways, and exhorted ’em to turn round and do better,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</span>and sed to ’em a few words of consolation about the
great blessin’ they had lost.</p>

<p>And then he folded his shroud around him with
one hand, and with quite a lot of dignity he stepped
up into a chair, and so into his coffin. Then he laid
down, arranged the folds of his shroud and crossed
his hands on his bosom and shet his eyes up. As
he did so the clock struck two. He laid a minute,
while a dumbfoundered look swep’ over his liniment,
and anon a sheepish one. And then he
lifted up his head and looked round, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>And one of the cousins, one he had rasped down
the hardest (they wuz at swords’ pints anyway,
caused by line fences), he hollered out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think there wuz, you dum fool you!
gittin’ us all here right in hayin’ time to hear your
dum funeral sermon.”</p>

<p>And another one he had reviled yelled out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you do as you agreed, you consarned
loonatick, you!”</p>

<p>And still another cried&mdash;“We’ll have the law on
you for this! You agreed to die, and we all got
together for that purpose, and we’ll see if we’re goin’
to be bamboozled and fooled in this way. It is all
a contrived plan to abuse us and make fun on us.
But I’ll see if I can’t make you sick of sech dum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</span>nonsense,” sez he. And he rushed for the live
body with sech vengeance in his eyes and a wooden
stool in his hand that the body’s wife precipitated
herself onto the coffin, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will perish with this noble man, if die he must”
(you see he’d worked her all up about his worth).</p>

<p>Wall, suffice it to say, the cousin wuz overmastered,
and etiket prevailed, and decorum wuz established,
and the crowd dispersed, leavin’ him still in
his coffin, for he sed he wuz tired, and would lay
there for a spell.</p>

<p>I believe he wuz ’fraid to git out. It kinder protected
his lims and body. But then mebby he told
the truth; the sermon wuz a powerful one, and delivered
loud&mdash;it must have used up considerable
wind.</p>

<p>Wall, they talked hard of sendin’ Jake Bilhorn to
the asylum. He escaped it jest by the skin of his
teeth, as the sayin’ is. His wife testified to the last
minute that his mind wuz weak, and he couldn’t
help it. But she would watch him, she sed, and
take care on him. So it wuz agreed that he should
be let off on the Idiot Act, and she promised to let
him go to the loonatick asylum if he ever tried to git
up any sech performance agin.</p>

<p>But I am a-eppisodin’, and a-eppisodin’ too fur,
too fur.</p>

<p class="h2sub">AL FAIZI SAYS GOOD-BYE.</p>

<p>Wall, the very next day, follerin’ and ensuin’ after
our visit to the Escuriel, Martin gin orders for the
march.</p>

<p>We wuz to git back to London at the rapidest
rate possible, and from thence embark for home.</p>

<p>Home! sweet sound! No word ever did, or ever
can, sound so sweet as that word “home” duz hearn
on a foreign shore. And though the journey seemed
long and perilous and full of fatigue and danger,
yet Josiah and I hearn it with joy.</p>

<p>So after a journey that seems, to look back on’t,
like a confused dream of wonderful sights, and
strange ones, rumatiz, car whistles, big hotels, cold
beds, dyspeptic food, groans, sithes, beautiful views
seen from flyin’ trains, talk in a strange language
goin’ on round me, murmured words from a pardner,
better left onsaid, dreams of home sot in a frame of
foreign seenery, tired eyes and lims, dizzy flyin’
through space, headache, etc., etc., etc., after this
dream we found ourselves in London.</p>

<p>We parted with Al Faizi in London. It wuz on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</span>the eve of our departure. Our tickets reposed in
Martin’s vest-pocket, so I spoze, and our ship wuz
to sail on the morrer.</p>

<p>The lamps wuz lit in our room, and their meller
glow lit up the form of my companion, clad in
his dressin’-gown and layin’
outstretched on the
couch.</p>

<p>I myself wuz a-rubbin’
my spectacles with shammy-skin.</p>

<p>I see the minute that
Al Faizi come in that he
looked sort o’ agitated
and riz up like. And
anon I understood the
reason&mdash;he had come to
bid us good-bye.</p>

<p>I felt mean&mdash;mean as
a dog. I hated to have
him go, though Common
Sense told me, and, of
course, I didn’t spoze that I could in the common
nater of things lug round a heathen with me everywhere
I went all my life; but still I felt bad.</p>

<p>After the first compliments wuz spoke, and
he told us that he wuz a-goin’, and we told him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</span>that we hated to have him go, and, etc., he
sez:</p>

<p>“I have sought for the ways of love and truth
all through these Western lands&mdash;and now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, and only his dark, sad eyes spoke
for quite a spell. Finally I sez:</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>“I go back to my own country&mdash;I have many
things to teach my people.”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>have</i> learnt some good things in my
country and on our tower?” sez I, glad and proud
to hear him say so.</p>

<p>But his soft voice resoomed&mdash;“I have to teach
them many things&mdash;to avoid.”</p>

<div class="figright illowp71" id="i_675" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_675.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“<span class="smcap">I go back to my own country&mdash;I have many things
 to teach my people&mdash;to avoid.</span>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>I felt deprested agin. “But,” sez I, wantin’ to
git some closter view of his mind&mdash;wantin’ to like
a dog, for I hadn’t had, I can truly say, any more
clear view on’t than if we had lived some milds
apart, sez I, “you must have seen some things in
this land worthy your approvin’ of&mdash;these lofty
cathedrals built to the honor of the Lord. To
be sure,” sez I, “the poor are a-flockin’ round ’em
like a herd of freezin’ and starvin’ animals. But
look at the free schools and the great charities,
mighty and fur reachin’ in their influence.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez Al Faizi, “I have seen some things in
your land that I will teach them to do. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</span>seen sweet charities&mdash;the sick and unfortunate
cared for; great free schools; crowds of little
children helped to better lives.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I, “a great many rich men and
wimmen give their money like water to help the
poor and unfortunate. To be sure,” sez I, “the
poverty and the crime is caused, most of it, by ourselves,
and Uncle Sam bein’ so sot on that license
business of hisen.” Sez I, “We cause the evils we
relieve in a great measure&mdash;but then&mdash;”</p>

<p>I see that Al Faizi wuz a-lookin’ at me with that
same calm, sweet smile, and I’ll be hanged if it
seemed as if I could go on a-drivin’ them metafors
right in front of it. It made me feel curous as a
dog, and curouser to think on’t.</p>

<p>There it wuz, he a-settin’ right by me, and I
couldn’t git a full, clear view of what wuz a-goin’ on
in his mind, his idees and emotions, no more’n
I can see the high trees in our orchard in a heavey
snow-storm.</p>

<p>I spoze I showed my deep chagrin in my face, for
he hastened to add:</p>

<p>“Everywhere I see strivings after the Good&mdash;the
Perfect Life. The nations are feeling after God.
But I see His truth covered up by a network of
man-made lies; and shadows of darkness, cast from
human comprehension, veil and shadow the sweet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</span>just face of the Good. But evermore my heart
burns within me, and I long for the perfect way.”</p>

<p>Right here my Josiah spoke up in this unappropos
moment, and sez:</p>

<p>“I hate to say good-bye, Fazer, but if you ever
come up our way from Hindoostan, or Egypt, or
Africa, or wherever you are a-stayin’, you must be
sure to stop and stay overnight with us.”</p>

<p>Adrian come in at that minute, and when I told
him that Al Faizi was a-biddin’ us good-bye, and
wuz a-goin’ away, he put both arms around his neck
and nestled his head aginst him. Al Faizi pressed
him clost to his heart and bent his head low over
him, and when he let him go, sunthin’ bright shone
amongst the curls and waves of Adrian’s gold-brown
locks, that Alice loved so well.</p>

<p>Custom and pride makes folks reticent and keep
their griefs to themselves, but as long as human
hearts are made as they be now, they will ache.
Love’s arrers are sharp winged; when they fly they
don’t take any note of where they are a-goin’, and
the pain is keen and sharp when they hit&mdash;bittersweet
at any time, and sometimes bitter without the
sweet. The good Lord go with Al Faizi and comfort
him, so I sez to myself.</p>

<p>He took both of my hands in his little brown
ones, and it seemed as if he would never let ’em go.</p>

<p>“I will never forget you!” he cried; “you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</span>
had for me the kind heart and kind deeds of a
mother.”</p>

<p>I thought to myself that he might jest as well
sed a “sister” while he wuz about it, but then I
laid it to the excitement of the occasion&mdash;I wuz excited
myself and felt bad. I hated to have him go,
and when he wuz a-goin’ to let go of my hands I
didn’t know. I wuz a-thinkin’ that if he offered to
kiss me I didn’t know what I should do&mdash;it wuzn’t
nothin’ I wanted, leavin’ Josiah out of the question,
but I didn’t know what he would take it into his
head to do. But he didn’t offer nothin’ of the kind,
which I wuz glad enough on. But he gin my hands
a long, hard clasp, and sez he:</p>

<p>“Farewell!” And then he let go. He looked
bad, sorrerful as death. And I sez, onbeknown to
me:</p>

<p>“Won’t you wait and bid good-bye to Alice?”</p>

<p>“No,” sez he; “I leave with you my farewell to
her. May heaven bless her!” sez he.</p>

<p>“Amen!” sez I.</p>

<p>It wuz some as if we wuz to protracted meetin’,
only more strange-like, and mebby not quite so
protracted, but curouser.</p>

<p>Sez I, with a real good axent&mdash;“My heart will
go with you, Al Faizi; I shall think of you when
you’re fur away, some as I do of my own boy&mdash;knowin’
that you are doin’ your best for your own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</span>
soul, and for everybody round you.”</p>

<p>“I go to my own people,” sez he sadly. “Forevermore
will I work to help them to the right
way&mdash;help them to understand the teachings of
the Lord Christ. Nowhere else do I find such a
pure religion as His. In my own home, far away
beyond the dark waters”&mdash;and he made that
gester of his towards the East&mdash;“I will work
till I die to bring my people to know this
great love, this mighty King. And there also
I will pray that your people, too, may follow His
teachings, and the people in the great countries
I have visited with you, that these lands may
renounce their false ways, and follow His gentle and
lovely guidance, and be led into His truth. I will
give my life for this,” sez he.</p>

<p>His tone wuz sweet and tender. It sounded to
me sunthin’ like the autumn winds a-rustlin’ the
leaves over the grave of the one you love.</p>

<p>I wuz almost a-cryin’, and sez I:</p>

<p>“Shan’t we ever see you agin?”</p>

<p>He pinted upwards, his eyes wuz full of the
love and passion of devotion, of Christian
feelin’.</p>

<p>“We will meet in that great land,” sez he.</p>

<p>I wuz dretful riz up and glad and deprested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</span> and
sorry all to one time. I felt queer.</p>

<p>But Josiah had to holler most the last minute.
Sez he, “What are you a-goin’ to do with that book
of yourn, Fazer?”</p>

<p>“I will use it to help teach my people&mdash;to avoid
the mistakes of civilization.”</p>

<p>Josiah sez, “Good for you, Fazer!”</p>

<p>And I sez, “I always felt that we ort to have
missionaries come over here to teach us how to behave.”</p>

<p>But his face had no triumph in it&mdash;no look of
reproach, only that sweet smile rested on it that
made his face look better than any face I ever see,
or ever expect to see.</p>

<p>And agin he took my hand in his little brown
one; agin he said “Farewell,” and he wuz indeed
gone.</p>

<p>I didn’t git over it all day.</p>

<p>I felt some as if the meetin’-house to Jonesville
should dissapear mysteriously, as if sunthin’ good
had vanished, and some as if my boy Thomas J.
should go off out of my sight for some time.</p>

<p>Adrian mourned for him several hours. Alice
wuz writin’ a letter home, and didn’t hardly seem to
know that he wuz gone, and Martin wuz glad, I
believe. He had never took to him for a minute.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</span></p>
<p>Wall, I will hang up a thick moreen curtain between
my readers and the voyage homewards.</p>

<p>It needs a thick curtain to hide the fraxious,
querilous complaints and the actin’s of my pardner,
the howlin’s of the wind and waves, and the usual
discomforts of a sea voyage.</p>

<p>There are times when Heaven knows I wuz glad
to hide behind it myself.</p>

<p>Yes, I will cower down behind the thick folds,
knowin’ that I am doin’ the best I can for myself
and the world at large. Yes, I will let ’em droop
down over our voyage through the wild waves, our
arrival in our own dear native land, our feelin’s when
we see the shore we loved dawn on us out of the
mist, and when we sot our feet on the sile of the
Continent that wears Jonesville like a pearl of
great price on its tawny old bosom.</p>

<p>I will also let its thick folds screen us in our
partin’ from Martin and the children, and our lonely
but short journey by our two selves.</p>

<p>And I will only loop that curtain back in
graceful folds as we draw nigh to Jonesville&mdash;Mecca
of our hearts’ hopes and love.</p>

<p class="h2sub">HOME AGAIN, FROM A FOREIGN SHORE.</p>

<p>Jonesville wuz bathed in the rosy hue of sunset
when Ury let down the bars and we passed up into
the lane leadin’ to our dear home&mdash;that sweet, restful
haven, into which Josiah and me truthfully felt
that our barks would sail in and be moored forever
and ever.</p>

<p>Yes, we both felt that nothin’, nothin’ could
tempt us agin to spread our sails and float out of
that blessed Home Harbor.</p>

<p>How soft the light fell onto the white curtains
with lace agin’! How sweet the rosy glow illumined
the piaza and front yard, and how it played round
the red chimblys and Philury’s collar, as she stood
in the front stoop to welcome us home! Inside
the house wuz all lit up, and when we entered, there
wuz the children all come to surprise us, and welcome
us home. They had sent Philury out, like
the dove, on the front doorstep, while they stayed
in the ark to surprise Ma and Pa when we
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p>They had sent Philury out, like a dove, on the front doorstep to meet us.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Oh, how glad they wuz to see us, and visey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</span>versey. Yes, indeed, I guess it wuz visey versey&mdash;the
children and grandchildren almost eat us up,
and we them.</p>

<p>A beautiful supper wuz a-waitin’ the tired-out
travellers. The girls had laid to and helped, and it
wuz a supper long to be remembered, and the children’s
and the grandchildren’s demeanors to us wuz as
tender as the briled chicken and cream biscuit, and
the ties of love that united us all together wuz as
strong as the coffee, and stronger, too, and mellered
down by our happiness, jest as that wuz with
lump-sugar and rich cream. And, oh, how good!
how good it did feel to be to home! Josiah the first
thing pulled off his boots and went round in his
stockin’ feet.</p>

<p>I sez, “Why do you do that, Josiah?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for no reason, only to swing out and do
jest as I’m a-mind to. After bein’ cramped and
hampered for months, I’m a-goin’ to act and feel
to home, and I’m a-goin’ barefoot for a spell,” sez
he, “as soon as the children go.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, he did, for all I could do and
say, and he sung several pieces while I wuz ondressin’&mdash;he
sung ’em loud. I remember he sung
the hull of “Robert Kidd” and “André’s Lament,”
besides some hymns.</p>

<p>Sez he, “I’ve been pent up and bound down so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</span>long that I’m a-goin’ to swing right out and act all
I want to.”</p>

<p>And happy&mdash;why, happy is no name for the
feelin’s of that man, and I felt the same&mdash;yes,
indeed! Only, as my nater is, I acted more megum,
though I did kinder jine in with him in the chorus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My name is Robert Kidd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I sailed, as I sailed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I wuz so perfectly happy that I had to.</p>

<p>And when he struck into the hymns I jined in
strong, right there in my nightgown&mdash;“On
Canaan’s happy banks I stand,” and “Long time I
have wandered,” and etcetery.</p>

<p>Why, Josiah sung the most of the time for days
and days.</p>

<p>When Deacon Henzy come to see him, instead
of advancin’ and shakin’ hands dignified, as a foreign
traveller ort to, he jest advanced onto him, a-singin’
loud&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Home agin, Deacon, home agin, from a foreign shore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, oh! it fills my soul with joy</div>

  </div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It spilte the meter, but he didn’t care. He acted
fairly crazed with joy to be home.</p>

<p>The first thing he done the next mornin’ when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</span>he got up wuz to throw his best clothes in a sort of
a scornful heap behind his closet door. He
throwed ’em some as if he hated the very sight on
’em. When I found ’em afterwards, all tumbled
in together, we had a number of
words.</p>

<p>But, as I say, he throwed his best
clothes there, and specially his stiff
collars and cuffs&mdash;them looked some
as if they’d been trompled on.</p>

<p>And then that man got on the
worst-lookin’ pair of pantaloons and
vest you ever see&mdash;holes in the knees,
and the vest ripped up in the back,
and the pockets hangin’ outside. I’d
been a-savin’ ’em for carpet rags.</p>

<p>And he went down suller and took
a old coat offen the apple-ben. We
had used it for two winters to cover
up the apples in extra cold nights.
And the land knows where he got
the hat he put on&mdash;a old straw, the
rim a-hangin’ half off, and the crown
all jammed in. I guess he found it up in the
woodhouse chamber.</p>

<p>But, anyway, his looks wuz sech, so onbecomin’
to a deacon and a pathmaster, let alone a cultered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</span>gentleman of foreign travel, that I took him to do
sharply about it.</p>

<div class="figright illowp31" id="i_687" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_687.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>His looks wuz so onbecomin’
to a deacon and
a pathmaster.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sez I, “I won’t have you a-goin’ round lookin’
worse than any old scarecrow, Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>He took up a position in front of me, where his
rags showed off to the most plainest advantage, and
sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>“As you see me now, Samantha, you will see me
henceforth. I shall never, never be dressed up
agin as long as I retain my conscientiousness.”</p>

<p>He spoke so firm, I felt some browbeat and
skairt.</p>

<p>Sez I faintly, “Do you expect to go through
your life a-lookin’ as you do now?”</p>

<p>“Always, always, Samantha; only worse, if I can
manage it.” Sez he bitterly, “I am a man that has
been dressed up too long; the iron has entered too
deep into my soul&mdash;the worm has turned,” sez he.
“I calculate to go in rags the rest of my life. And
I wish,” sez he in a pleadin’ axent, “I wish that
you would promise that you would bury me in this
suit&mdash;that you would take a vow that I shall not
be dressed up.”</p>

<p>I wuz at my wits’ end; he looked as determined
as any old hen turkey ever did on her nest.</p>

<p>But by a happy inspiration I sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you ruther lay in your dressin’-gown,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</span>
Josiah? Think of them beautiful tossels,”
sez I.</p>

<p>I see a change come over his mean; he wavered
and turned onto his heel, and went out-doors.</p>

<p>And I may as well tell the end on’t. It wuz
that dressin’-gown that gradual won him back into
decenter clothin’.</p>

<p>I lured him into that at first, and then gradual
into pepper-and-salt, and so on to broadcloth; but
it wuz a hard tussle! Collars and cuffs wuz my
worst battle-field, but I got the victory over ’em
at last.</p>

<p>Oh, dear me, dear me, suz! what hard times female
pardners do have anon or oftener; but yet
I believe that pardners pay, after all.</p>

<p>And it did seem so good to walk round the
house, free and ontrammelled, and see the old
bureaus and tables once more, and sasspans and
things; and go out into the garden and see the
garden-truck, and walk out to the barn and gather
the eggs, and count the chickens.</p>

<p>And plunge into all the sweet delights that make
home a perfect Eden.</p>

<p>Yes, we both felt that we should never want to
move a inch from our own fireside. But how
little&mdash;how little we can tell what is ahead on us in
the onseen futer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</span></p>
<p>In this case Alice wuz ahead.</p>

<p>We hadn’t been to home more’n several weeks
when that sweet creeter wrote to me, urgin’ me hard
to come and see her.</p>

<p>She didn’t make no open complaints, but all
through the letter I could read between the lines,
as it wuz, the echoes of a sad heart.</p>

<p>I felt, as I read it, that I ort to go right away and
see her.</p>

<p>But I hated to leave home agin&mdash;I hated to like
a dog.</p>

<p>So I writ her back as lovin’ a letter as I could,
and I kinder waved off the subject of my comin’,
sayin’ I’d come jest as soon as I could.</p>

<p>A week or more passed, then come a letter from
Martin, sayin’ Alice wuzn’t very well, and had sot
her heart on seein’ me&mdash;wouldn’t I come?</p>

<p>I went.</p>

<p>Alice wuz dretful glad to see me, and in my lovin’
sympathy her white face seemed to git a little
more color and brightness into it.</p>

<p>Good land! I see what ailed her jest as well as
though I had took our big parlor lamp and walked
through her mind.</p>

<p>Her father wuz jest as determined as ever that
she should have nothin’ to do or say to Richard
Noble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</span></p>

<p>And bein’ right here by his side, as it were, and
forbid to see him or speak to him made it fur worse
than it wuz when they wuz seperated by a ocean.
Her Pa had planned in his own mind that this
trip should ween her from him. But how mistook
he wuz!</p>

<p>She had carried a faithful, lovin’ heart over the
Atlantic, and had brung it back with her.</p>

<p>Distance had only drawed the ends of the love-knot,
unitin’ their souls all the tighter. They
couldn’t be ontwisted now by the hands of a Martin&mdash;no,
indeed!</p>

<p>Martin wuz dretful good to me. He see that
Alice loved me and brightened up considerable in
my presence. And that would have made Miss
Belzebub welcome.</p>

<p>And Adrian, how he did hang round me, sweet
little creeter that he wuz!</p>

<p>Yes, Alice wuz the same, and Martin wuz the
same as before his trip. He kep’ right on in the
same old roteen of money-makin’, and money-savin’,
and obstinacy, and sotness, and ambition, and
etcetery.</p>

<p>I found that out only a few mornin’s after I got
there.</p>

<p>I happened to take up a daily paper, and I read a
piece in it about a horrible axident that had took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</span>place right there in the city a few days before&mdash;two
children killed, and the driver of the car had
died from the effects of the horrow and remorse he
had experienced in causin’ the death of the two
children.</p>

<p><i>Died!</i> when the poor creeter wuz no more guilty
than a babe for it. He wuzn’t no more guilty than
the spokes in the wheels. They all wuz run by
another’s orders.</p>

<p>As I sed, I wuz so horrified by it, that I felt that
mad him or not, I must tackle Martin about the
matter.</p>

<p>And I found that he wuz as stiffnecked and rambellous
as a iron-clad about it.</p>

<p>And we had a number of words.</p>

<p>And in the course of our conversation I atted
Martin agin about Alice’s lover. For her big, sad
eyes had follered me all the time I’d been there, and
I had vowed in my heart that I would help her to
her happiness if I could.</p>

<p>As I sed, the pretty creeter had took her faithful
heart over the Atlantic, and carried it round with
her all the time she wuz there, and had brung it
back with her.</p>

<p>Movin’ the body round don’t change the soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">MARTIN’S TERRIBLE LESSON.</p>

<p>Wall, I found that Martin wuz as immovable
and sot as a rock. “As for Alice,” sez he, “I told
you six months ago what I should do, and I never
change my mind.”</p>

<p>And agin I sez, “Sometimes folks are made
to change their minds when they don’t mean to or
want to.”</p>

<p>But before I could multiply any more words with
him a servant come in to say that a paintin’ had come
that Martin had ordered while he wuz abroad.
And he asked me quite polite to go in and see
it.</p>

<p>He wuz glad of the interruption. He wanted to
change the subject&mdash;he wanted to like a dog.</p>

<p>The picter had been onpacked, and wuz standin’
in the big hall, waitin’ for Martin to decide where to
hang it.</p>

<p>It wuz called “The Mother’s Sacrifice,” and wuz
the picter of a Eastern mother, who wuz a-throwin’
her child under the wheels of a juggernaut to insure
its everlastin’ salvation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</span></p>
<p>Her face wuz torn with love and duty. It wuz
a impressive picter. He gin twenty thousand dollars
for it, for he told me so.</p>

<p>Sez Martin as we looked at it, full of the rich
Oriental glow of forest and landscape, and the dark,
frenzied beauty of the mother’s face and the innocent
beauty of the child, who trusts to her love and
care and don’t mistrust its impendin’ doom&mdash;</p>

<p>Sez Martin, “What a struggle is going on in that
woman’s breast! how her heart is torn between her
love for the child and her religious belief! What a
masterly handling of the subject!” sez he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez I; “but what of the hearts of the
mothers who see their children crushed down under
jest as murderous wheels, and don’t have her religious
zeal to hold ’em up? That Eastern mother
thinks that this will insure her child’s eternal well-bein’&mdash;she
thinks the wheels move on in the cause
of eternal good. What would she think if she wuz
a American mother, and knew these wheels murdered
her child jest to save a little money&mdash;jest out
of wicked, graspin’ avarice?”</p>

<p>Sez Martin coldly, “I don’t know what you
mean.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Yes you do, Martin; I mean your
trolley cars, that move on and crush down childhood
and age, when a little bit of money you spend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</span>for this ficticious woe would relieve the real agony
which is goin’ on right before your front gate
through your own neglect.”</p>

<p>I would gin him some sech little delicate hints,
whether he liked it or lumped it, as the sayin’ is.
Agin he sez in that dretful dignified way of hisen,
“I don’t know what you mean,” and turned away.</p>

<p>But jest as I wuz withdrawin’ myself from the
seen, for I felt that these little blind hits I gin him
wuz enough for the present, Adrian come in, and
Martin called out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, dear little Partner, what do you want?”</p>

<p>And Adrian sez, “Alice and I are going out
driving, and I wanted to say good-bye to you.”</p>

<p>Martin kissed the pretty face, with his adorin’
love for the child a-showin’ plain in him. And
then Adrian come and kissed me, his gold curls
fallin’ back from his little, earnest face, and his
black velvet cap a-settin’ ’em off first rate, and he
sez to me, “Good-bye;” and I hadn’t any way of
knowin’ that that good-bye would echo through
the long futer and die out only at the Dark
Portal.</p>

<p>Martin took out his purse and took out a roll of
bills and handed ’em to Adrian, and sez he,
“Hand that to your sister; I was going to give it
to her last night&mdash;it is for a necklace she wanted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</span>
Be careful of it,” sez Martin as Adrian took it;
“it is five thousand dollars, and that is worth
taking care of, little partner.”</p>

<p>Wall, they sot off, and I went back into a little
settin’-room acrost the hall from Martin’s study
and took up a book and went to readin’.</p>

<p>It wuz a interestin’ book, and I wuz carried
away&mdash;some distance away from the big city and
trolley cars.</p>

<p>When I heard a hum of a good many voices
in Martin’s room, and the door bein’ open, I
couldn’t help hearin’ what they wuz a-sayin’. It
seemed to be a deputation of some kind a-askin’
Martin for some favor or other.</p>

<p>For I heard him say out loud, “I am sick of
these complaints.”</p>

<p>His tone wuz cold&mdash;cold as a iceberg. There
wuz one man amongst ’em who seemed to be the
speaker; he sez, “We are workingmen; we have
homes and families. We work hard every day.
We leave our children, that we may go away and
earn food and clothing for them; our houses
are the best that we can afford, but the best that
we can pay for lay in the populous region where
so many lives are lost by these cars. I know you
are the owner of that line, and we have come to
appeal to you.”</p>

<p>Sez Martin agin, “I am sick to death of these
everlasting complaints.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Sez Martin agin, “I am sick to death of these everlasting
 complaints.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>His tone wuz cold&mdash;cold as a frog, and I see
from his voice that he wuz mad&mdash;mad as a wet hen.</p>

<p>The man that answered him I could see from
where I sot wuz evidently jest a plain workin’-man,
jest like ’em that you meet in droves at 7
o’clock in the mornin’ and six at night.</p>

<p>But I liked his looks&mdash;he looked rugged and
honest, and his voice had a uncultured ring of
common sense and honesty, and at times a deep
sorrer and sense of wrong touched it to a rude
eloquence.</p>

<p>Martin sez, and his tone wuz cold and smooth
as a icesuckle in a January mornin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is it that you want me to do, anyway&mdash;tell
me as briefly as you can, for my time is
valuable.”</p>

<p>Sez the man agin, “We are workingmen and
poor, and we do not expect to have many things
that rich people have, but we do want our children
to be educated. They must go out alone to their
schools while their mothers are at home working
to make a decent home for them, and they cannot
follow them only with their thoughts and
prayers.</p>

<p>“These cars going with the swiftness of lightning
through these thronged streets, with no safeguard to
protect them, are the means of making fathers’ and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</span>mothers’ hearts ache with fear and dread.</p>

<p>“One of my own children, a bright little lad, my
only son, dear to me as my own life, was crushed
down by them on his way to school.” The man’s
voice broke here, for a rush of feeling swep’ up agin
his voice, and stopped it.</p>

<p>“Another of these men lost a child, another saw
an old mother crushed down before his eyes as she
tried to cross the street, another&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is no need of repeating all this to me.
What do you want me to do?” I see by Martin’s
voice that he wuz madder than that wet hen a-settin’,
and obstinate.</p>

<p>“We want to have you give orders to go more
slowly through crowded places and put fenders on
the cars, so as to lessen the peril as much as may be,
so we poor people, who have to live and labor in
these dangerous places, can carry a lighter heart to
our hard daily toil.”</p>

<p>“Leave me your address,” sez Martin sharp and
cold, “and I will communicate with you.” Then
sez he, “James, show these men to the door. Good-morning,”
sez he. The door closed on the men, and
Martin crossed the hall with a quick step, and come
right into the room where I sot. In his haste to
git out of their sight he had, as the sayin’ is,
“jumped from the fryin’-pan into the fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</span></p>

<p>For I sez, and tears wuz in my eyes as I sed it&mdash;</p>

<p>“You will grant their request, Martin?”</p>

<p>“No, I will not grant their request;” and he
went on sarcastically, “I don’t know what you
people want. Do you want to do away with cars
and railroads and go back to ox-teams and pillions?
Here a few men take a big risk, put all
their capital into an enterprise, doing the public
an incalculable good, and then they have to be badgered
night and day by the very ones they have
benefited, and by a set of philanthropic fools.” I
guess he meant me by that last term, but I didn’t
care; I wouldn’t have cared if he’d called me a plain
fool&mdash;I knew I wuzn’t. When you are out a-ketchin’
a tiger you don’t care for a muskeeter’s bite;
no, your mind is sot on the tiger.</p>

<p>I sez, “The cost is but triflin’ to one of your
means. Why not do it?”</p>

<p>“Because I am capable of attending to my own
business, and I am not to be bossed by a lot of
workingmen and wild-eyed reformers and sentimental
idiots&mdash;I’ll do what I please.”</p>

<p>Sez I, “Mebby you will, Martin, and mebby you
won’t.”</p>

<p>Jest as I said these words a cry come up from
the streets&mdash;“A child run over! a lady killed! a
child and a lady killed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</span></p>

<p>“There,” sez Martin, actin’ impatient and mad
as anything&mdash;“there is another text for you, Cousin
Samantha; and probably the whole car full of people,
who have rode all over the city for five cents, will
all join in and shriek at me as a murderer and a villain,
because a couple of fools have started to cross
the track just in front of a car; in nine cases out of
ten the fault is their own.”</p>

<p>But the cries outside grew louder and louder, and
finally Martin went to the winder, kinder flingin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</span>himself along in a sort of a impatient way; and
he had been nagged considerable&mdash;I had to admit
it.</p>

<p>He went to the winder, which looked down onto
the broad street below. He looked a minute; then
shriekin’ out&mdash;</p>

<p>“My God! my God!”</p>

<p>He fell down jest like a log at my feet.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>He fell down jest like a log at my feet.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And what wuz the sight that struck him down
like a arrer?</p>

<p>Two men of the very deputation that had jest
left the house wuz bearin’ between ’em the crushed
form of a little boy&mdash;gold curls wuz hangin’ back
from the velvet cap. A kind hand had covered the
little disfiggered face with a handkerchief. Behind,
two more of the men and a policeman wuz carryin’
the crushed, senseless form of Alice.</p>

<p>I hearn all about it afterwards. There wuz a
florist jest acrost from Martin’s, where a little bend
in the road made it impossible to stop. Little
Adrian had jumped out of the carriage and run to
choose a bokay of flowers to gin to me. They wuz
the English voyalets he loved so well. One of ’em
wuz in the buttonhole of the little velvet coat.</p>

<p>Dear little creetur!</p>

<p>And as he ran back the flowers fell; he stopped
to pick ’em up, and the car swep’ down on him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</span>Alice see his danger, she jumped to save him, only
to be struck down herself.</p>

<p>Wall, what tongue of men or angels shall describe
the seen that follered and ensued.</p>

<p>Martin layin’ in a dead faint, like death to all appearance&mdash;and
it is blood relation to it. Little
Adrian layin’ white and cold on a couch in the reception-hall,
where the men had reverently laid him,
right under the picter of that Eastern mother.</p>

<p>The agony in her dark face seemed to be for him,
too&mdash;the fair-haired child of the race who condemn
their barbarity, and practise worse.</p>

<p>And Alice a-layin’ white and onconscious, but
breathin’ still, in her own room. One round, white
arm a-hangin’ broken by her side, and blood streamin’
from a cruel gash in her head.</p>

<p>Wall, the best doctors in the city wuz there in a
few minutes. But all their genius and wisdom and
learnin’ could not bring back the spark of life that
had flown away from little Adrian’s body.</p>

<p>And then afterwards the clergyman come and
whispered consolin’ words to Martin in his darkened
chamber.</p>

<p>But not all the preachin’ since Adam can make
death other than death.</p>

<p>Martin didn’t want the clergyman&mdash;he wanted to
be alone. He wouldn’t see anybody, and he lay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</span>still and cold after his senses come back&mdash;so still
and cold that the doctors feared for his sanity, and
even for his life.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of interest he showed wuz when
they told him that there wuz a
chance for Alice to live.</p>

<p>He turned his face towards the
wall (so the nurse told me, a good,
faithful creeter with a strong
breath, caused by stimulants, I believe).</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>A faithful creeter with a strong
breath, caused by stimulants, I
believe.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sez she, “I went to the foot
of the bed and looked up, and
see tears a-streamin’ down his
white face. But I dare not speak
to him,” sez she&mdash;“no, I dare not.”</p>

<p>Sez she, “His face had that
look on it that it frightened me,
and it gave me such a turn that
I feel weak yet. I guess,” sez she,
“I will take a drop to nerve me
up. Don’t you want a drop of
stimulant, too?” sez she.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” sez I, “I don’t!”</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, “poor creeter, do everything you
can for him, for the hand of the Lord has dealt
sorely with him. And,” sez I, “I would gladly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</span>help him if I could, but I can do nothin’ but pray
for him.”</p>

<p>Wall, there wuz a big funeral in the church
where little Adrian had been baptized when he wuz
a baby.</p>

<p>The minister, a very eloquent and high-priced
one, preached a beautiful sermon about the inscrutable
mysteries of our lives, and the mystery
of the Providence who should take, in sech
a onforeseen and onheard-of way the child of
sech a man, who had spent his hull life for the
good of the people&mdash;that angelic man, who wuz
a-layin’ now in his palatial home at the pint of
death.</p>

<p>These last words affected the congregation dretfully.
A maiden jest behind Martin’s pew and a
widder jest in front (who both had hopes) sallied
away and partially fainted, and the widder had to
be borne out by the sexton.</p>

<p>And as she wuz heavey, it bore hard on him. The
old maid revived in time to see the widder carried
out. Widders always will go further and resk
more than the more single ones.</p>

<p>And the maiden wuz wroth for fear that Martin
should hear of it that she didn’t go so fur herself as
the widder did.</p>

<p>I myself didn’t faint nor shed tears. I sot up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</span>straight in that luxurious pew and kep’ a-sayin’ in
my heart&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, God help that wretched man! God help
and comfort him, for nothin’ else can!”</p>

<p class="h2sub">“GOOD-NIGHT, LITTLE PARDNER.”</p>

<p>Wall, that night after the funeral I wuz called
down into the parlor to see a stranger&mdash;a good deal
devolved on me in that awful time; I kep’ calm, or
tried to, and that calmness wuz like a paneky to
’em round me, and they didn’t see the tumult of
pity and grief that wuz a-goin’ on inside of my
heart onbeknown to ’em.</p>

<p>I went down into the hall, and there I found a
handsome, noble-lookin’ young man, whose face
wuz so white with anguish and dread that I knew
before he spoke who he wuz, and sez I right out
the first thing, a-holdin’ out both my hands&mdash;</p>

<p>“Alice is better.”</p>

<p>He grasped holt of my hands as if he wouldn’t
never let go.</p>

<p>Sez he, “God bless you for saying that!” He
wouldn’t go into the parlor, nor set down, or nothin’.
But it got to be my stiddy practice to go down
into that hall two or three times a day to gin him
news, and as the news grew brighter every day, jest
so his face grew brighter, till it got luminous with
joy and gratitude the day I told him that Alice
wuz out of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</span></p>

<p>Wall, there come a day, long to be remembered,
when Martin sent for me. I wuz the first one he
asked to see. He couldn’t talk much, and I jest
grasped his hand and sez&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have been prayin’ for you, Martin.”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” he whispered, “I knew you would.”</p>

<p>And that wuz about all I could say. But I spoze
he felt the pity and sympathy that oozed out of my
sperit onbeknown to me as I looked down onto
that broken-hearted man, and he seemed to like to
have me round his room.</p>

<p>Wall, it wuz weeks before I could go home,
Josiah a-bearin’ up nobly, aided by Philury, and
a-bravely eatin’ pancakes in her hours of too burdened
haste, and a-writin’ to me to stay if I could
be of any comfort to ’em.</p>

<p>Noble man that he is, though small boneded
I am proud of him&mdash;a good deal of the time I am.</p>

<p>Wall, there come a time when Martin, a-settin’
up in his study and a-lookin’ over his papers, sent
for me, and spoke to me for the first time of
Adrian.</p>

<p>He didn’t cry. His speechless grief wuz beyend
that relief, but he gin me to understand that his life
wuz a blank to him now.</p>

<p>Sez I, “Martin, remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</span> that Alice is left to
you&mdash;you have one child left.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sez he, “but I want my boy!!” and he
busted right out into tears, and buried his face in
his hands.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_709.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>He busted out into tears and buried his face in
his hands.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sez I, “Martin, do you remember what the dear
little boy said&mdash;he wuz a-goin’ to be your
pardner?”</p>

<p>He groaned, “Why do you speak of
that? Do you want to kill me?”</p>

<p>“I want to help you, Martin.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever think
that Adrian can be your
pardner now, better than
he ever could if he wuz
on earth&mdash;as much better
as the glorified sperit
is above our common
humanity?”</p>

<p>But agin he groaned
out, “I want my boy!”</p>

<p>“It is hard, Martin,” sez I, a-layin’ my hand on
his bowed-down shoulders.</p>

<p>“It is hard to know that the sweet little voice is
silent on earth, but he can hear you&mdash;he is a-hearin’
you this minute; he hears the language of your
sperit as you vow to ondo the past so fur as you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</span>can&mdash;to go on in the futer and work for the poor,
as he wanted to.</p>

<p>“You can’t go agin these strong desires of your
little pardner, Martin&mdash;you’ve got to hear to ’em.
He is your pardner now jest as much as he ever
wuz, and more, only he has gone over the deep
waters into another country to tend to the interests
of the firm there. It is a country where the Right
is always done, where things that are wrong here
are made right&mdash;he will help you, Martin. He
wanted to work for the poor; why not let
him?”</p>

<p>He lifted his white face, tears a-streamin’ down
it, but as my meanin’ dawned on him his mean grew
a little mite brighter.</p>

<p>Sez I, “He is a-workin’ now for ’em.” Sez I,
“I see in the new look in your eyes the divine
work of your pardner.</p>

<p>“He is helpin’ you this minute to think softer
thoughts. He is helpin’ you to remember that you
are to spend your money and his&mdash;for you told him
that it belonged to you both equally&mdash;in helpin’ the
poor, in helpin’ to surround their lives with safeguards,”
sez I, a-wantin’ to strike while the iron
wuz hot.</p>

<p>“You are a-goin’ to git some fenders right off,
Martin.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</span></p>
<p>“Order five hundred of them right off&mdash;send for
a thousand of them.”</p>

<p>“No,” sez I, “Martin, be megum. You’ve got
to be megum in fenders as well as any other goodness.
Why order a thousand fenders for one hundred
cars?</p>

<p>“But,” sez I, “Martin, I will send for ’em.”
And I did, that very day, not knowin’ but he
would be some like Pharaoh, and his heart would be
hardened before night. I told his secretary within
a hour, and he ordered ’em before sundown on my
word. Oh, they think high on me&mdash;all on ’em!
He dassent refuse to take my orders.</p>

<p>But I’d no need to have worried&mdash;no, indeed! I
felt ashamed to think I had let my mind sally back
to that old Egyptian Pharaoh.</p>

<p>Martin’s repentance didn’t prove to be short-lived
and evanescent&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p>He divided his property equally between himself
and his little pardner. He invested his pardner’s
money to the best of his knowledge, and every cent
of the interest of that money, and it is a immense
sum&mdash;millions of dollars. He uses it only as the
steward of his pardner. It all goes to help the
poor&mdash;to try to defend ’em from dangers, temporal
and speritual, from want, and from the worst
of all dangers&mdash;Ignorance and Crime.</p>

<p>Dear little Silent Pardner! I wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</span> if you
know it? I wonder if, when grateful hearts rise in
prayer, callin’ you the saviour of their lives and
happiness&mdash;I wonder if them prayers and grateful
thoughts bloom out in some divine way, as they
reach the Heavenly country, so you can see the
desire of your little heart, and know that it is
granted?</p>

<p>Are you ever permitted to come down in the
stillness of a Summer evenin’ and stand clost by the
side of that white-haired old man, who grew old so
fast after you left him, whose heart yearns for you,
and who is a-tryin’ so faithfully to carry out his little
pardner’s wishes? He sez that sometimes he
feels that you are so near to him that he almost expects
to see your face blossom out of the dark, like
the evenin’ star out of the misty twilight. And so
he can live, he sez.</p>

<p>Did you stand in the church when Alice wuz
married to the man she loved? A ray of gold light
shone out sudden and luminous and lit her sweet
face as she took her solemn vows.</p>

<p>Wuz it you, little Pardner? wuz the joy and glory
in your face permitted to shine for a moment on
the one you loved, in the supreme hour of her
life?</p>

<p>We can’t tell this, little Adrian, but we see
your work goin’ on from day to day, and we bless
you for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</span></p>

<p>We see it in the safety and protection thrown
around the masses, protectin’ ’em from physical
and moral ills; in the great free school which bears
your name; in the Adrian Home, where sick and
poor children find a home and tender care; in the
University, where your picter hangs over the doorway&mdash;a
doorway where any poor, ignorant boy may
enter, and go out a scholar; in the large, plain
church, whose best ornament is the stained-glass
winder bearin’ your name in gold letters, where a
pure Christianity is taught to all, rich and poor, and
the Blessed Master is brought near to sad lives by
the anointed lips of consecrated genius&mdash;where
rich and poor worship the God man together.
The poor givin’ their strength and good-will, the
rich givin’ their wealth and learnin’, and so becomin’
a strong bulwark, protectin’ society from the
high flood of undisciplined passions&mdash;Ignorance
and Crime.</p>

<p>Do you see it all, little Pardner? Sometimes I
think you do.</p>

<p>I am writin’ this at the open winder you looked
out of as you sed you would work for the poor.</p>

<p>And as I think how you have worked for ’em,
and are still a-workin’, my heart is as full of the

thought of you, little Adrian, as the voyalets you
loved are filled with their strong, onseen perfume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</span></p>

<p>And as I set askin’ these questions, the twilight
shades are fallin’, the evenin’ star shines bright above
the golden west.</p>

<p>And wuz that the odor of English voyalets that
swep’ by the open winder on the night breeze?
There’s a bed of ’em down in the garden. Did the
soft breeze come from that way&mdash;or further off?</p>

<p>But I stop and lean out of the winder and say&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good-night, little Adrian&mdash;good-night, little
Pardner&mdash;till mornin’.”</p>

<p>And wuz that a soft, fur-off echo, or wuz it my
own thoughts that repeated&mdash;“Till mornin’”?</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
